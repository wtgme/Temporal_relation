HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ri Strength is a 40 year old man with a history of GERD , who presents with abdominal pain of seven days duration .
The patient was in general good health until seven days ago ( 2/11/00 ) , when he had a sudden onset of sharp left flank pain with radiation to the lower abdomen and then to the epigastrium .
The patient described the pain as &quot; knife-like &quot; with a severity of 1/25 at its worse .
The patient was exacerbated when eating and when lying flat .
The patient also reports blood-streaked diarrhea for two days .
He denies nausea and vomiting .
He has had no fevers or chills .
He has had no recent weight loss , no light-headedness or dizziness .
He denies increased urinary frequent or urgency .
The patient presented to the Sloan- Center Emergency Department , where he was resuscitated with normal saline and received morphine for pain .
He was then transferred to the general medicine service for further management .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On admission , the patient was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis .
He was made NPO and was resuscitated with IV fluids .
Pain control was initiated with morphine but was then changed to Demerol , which gave the patient better relief of his epigastric pain .
From 2/17/00 to 2/21/00 , the patient complained of persistent and occasionally severe epigastric pain .
His pain medication was then changed to Dilaudid IV in an attempt to better alleviate his symptoms .
Dilaudid IV was continued for the remainder of the patient &apos;s hospitalization .
The does was titrated to the patient &apos;s need for comfort and was eventually tapered .
The severity and persistent of the patient &apos;s epigastric pain was concerning for a pancreatic complication such as necrosis or abscess .
The patient had a CT scan , which revealed a mass in the gallbladder neck , but no biliary dilatation .
There was stranding along the pancreas , but no necrosis , abscess , or pseudocyst .
On 2/22/00 , the patient had fevers to 103.5 .
Blood and urine cultures were sent .
A chest x-ray was done , which revealed no infiltrate or effusion .
The patient was started on cefotaxime 1 gm IV for empiric antibiotic treatment .
All cultures were negative .
On 2/23/00 , the high grade fever persisted .
An ultrasound was done to R / O cholestasis or cholangitis .
The ultrasound showed biliary sludge and swelling of the body and tail of the pancreas .
No other abnormalities were noted .
On 2/24/00 , the patient had an episode of exacerbation of epigastric pain with radiation to the left upper quadrant .
The pain was subsequently relieved with high dose Dilaudid .
The patient had a follow-up chest x-ray , which was essentially unchanged from previously , showing a normal heart and lungs without infiltrate .
From 2/25 - 2/27/00 , the patient &apos;s fever defervesced and his abdominal pain gradually subsided .
The cefotaxime was discontinued since no infection was identified .
On 2/28/00 , the patient &apos;s diet was advanced to a low fat solids ( per pancreatitis study ) , which the patient tolerated well .
The patient was discharged home on 2/29/00 , with much improvement of his symptoms ."

PROCEDURES :
Adenosine stress test .
Part 1 of a sleep study .
Coronary angiogram .
Chest CT .
Chest x-ray .
HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman with a history of CAD status post non ST elevation MI in 11/17 who presents with chest pain X 48 hours .
He went to Padrugmoff Hospital Emergency Room .
He has a history of hypertension , diabetes , and high cholesterol .
In 2003 , he had a non ST elevation MI , came to the RWH , and had a cath done , which showed a 40% RCA , which was hazy .
An IVUS was done , and it was felt that it was more severe .
He underwent a PTC stenting of an RCA with a Vision stent , 3 x 18 .
Diagonal 1 also had a 99% stenosis .
There was no other noted disease .
Since then , the patient has occasional chest pain with emotional stress , when he is angry or upset .
Yesterday morning , he developed intermittent substernal chest pain with radiation to the left shoulder that worsened with any activity and any motion of his shoulders .
It progressed over the course of the day requiring less movement .
He also became short of breath with climbing a flight of stairs .
He denies diaphoresis or nausea .
He went to the Padrugmoff Hospital Emergency Room after trying nitroglycerin at home .
However , his nitroglycerin was old and the script was expired .
In the ER , he received 3 sublingual nitroglycerins and 1 mg of Dilaudid .
After that , he was pain-free .
Lopressor IV was given to control his heart rate .
He also received Lipitor 80 mg , Plavix 300 , heparin IV , integrelin double bolus , followed by a drip .
Apparently once his pain was free , his EKG was noted to have hyperacute T-wave anteriorly without progression .
He was transferred to the Ro Woodma Healthcare for further cardiac care .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient ruled out for an MI with negative CK X4 and negative troponin X4 .
He was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Lab where cath showed top-normal LVEDP at 12 ; no AF ; widely patent RCA stent ; mild CAD in the left coronary artery symptom ; widely patent diagonal 1 at the site of prior PTCA .
He received an Angio-Seal to the right common femoral artery .
He then underwent a CT scan to rule out a PE .
That test was negative .
He underwent lower extremity study to rule out a DVT in both legs .
That was negative .
He was noted to have an episode of desaturation into the 80% range while sleeping .
Pulmonary consult was done , and it was felt that the patient should undergo a formal sleep study , full PFTs , and a repeat CT scan in 1 year to assess for pulmonary nodule that was seen .
However , please note that this nodule has been stable over time .
The patient also complained of intermittent right neck swelling , and recommendations are to consider a CT scan with contrast to evaluate nodes in his neck .
On physical exam today , the patient did not have any swelling , and he states that he did not feel the swelling was present .
The patient underwent an adenosine stress test , where he exercised for 4 minutes , reaching 65% of predicted heart rate .
He did not have chest pain .
EKG was negative for ischemia .
The myocardial perfusion images show no definite evidence of ischemia .
The LV contractile function was normal .
There was mild posterior vasal thinning .
It is not clearly outside normal limits .
He underwent an echocardiogram , which showed an EF of 60% .
There was no evidence of MVP .
There was trace mitral regurgitation .
There was no evidence of LA dilatation .
There was no aortic stenosis .
There was trace aortic insufficiency .
The LV cavity size was normal .
The systolic function was within normal limits .
There was no evidence of LV hypertrophy .
There was no obvious segmental wall-motion abnormality .
There was no evidence of pericardial effusion .
The right ventricle was not dilated .
The systolic function was within normal limits .
The patient underwent a sleep study , the first part , which showed that he had 75 respiratory events observed with apnea , hypopnea index of 11 an hour .
The mean heart rate was 68 .
They felt that there was obstruction and possible obstruction to airflow generating some obstructive apnea , as well as partial obstructive events .
They recommended that the patient may benefit from a trial of continuous positive pressure at the bedside .
The patient has been scheduled to have the second part of the sleep study done on June 18 , 2006 , at 8:30 p.m. at RWH in the Esley Community Hospital , 10th floor sleep lab , phone number 133-225-1257 .
Prior to discharge today , he underwent PFTs .
The results of the PFTs are unavailable at the time of this dictation .
Based on all the tests above , it was felt that the patient was stable for discharge home .
His blood pressure was 114 to 123/62 .
Heart rate 69 to 80 .
Room air saturation 96% .
Temperature 97.9 .
Lung sounds clear bilaterally .
Heart sounds :
Regular rate and rhythm ; S1-S2 ; positive S4 ; no murmur .
Abdomen :

MEDICINE
History of Present Illness :
45M w/no PMH presented to Chelseahospital after a syncopal episode on the morning of admission .
Pt was preparing lunch when suddenly felt lightheaded / faint and immediately fell to the kitchen floor face first .
He denies LOC .
Immediately there after he was very short of breath , felt lightheaded again and called 911 .
At Springfield , CT chest was positive for saddle PE .
VS were with stable BPs , tachy to 110-120 , sat 98% RA .
He received Lovenox 91 mg SC prior to transport and was transferred to Arbour Hospital for further care .
Mr. Anders states that 2 weeks prior to his presentation he hurt his left knee .
He was sitting on the floor legs crossed and stood up when he heard his knee CMED CCU .
Then again on Sunday , 3 days PTA , again from sitting to standing heard his knee CMED CCU .
He was essentially bed bound for 3 days prior to admission , unable to ambulate .
He started to notice inflammation of his L calf / leg worse 2 days prior to presentation .
In this 2 week interval he denied having CP / chest discomfort or difficulty breathing , no cough or hemoptysis .
No f/c/ sweats .
Pt denied any bleeding or clotting disorders and has never had a clot in the past .
Brief Hospital Course :
Mr. Anders was admitted for anticoagulation and hemodynamic monitoring in the setting of saddle pulmonary embolus and left knee injury .
#. PE :
Given no other risk factors or likely causes , the most likely etiology for his embolus is DVT from the left leg .
He has no known clotting disorder but did have trauma to leg prompting immobility and stasis .
He remained hemodynmically stable throughout his hospitalization and did not have an oxygen requirement upon discharge .
Given no evidence of hemodynamic instability , lysis was not required .
He was anticoagulated with heparin and coumadin .
He will need to follow up with hematology for an outpatient thrombophilia work-up ( not done as inpatient as results would not change acute management of PE ).
He will also require close follow up with his primary care provider for coumadin management .
Duration of his coumadin therapy to be determined by hematology , but likely to be at least 6 months in duration .
#. Syncope :
In setting of PE .
Remainder of his cardiac workup was negative .
He did have a small troponin leak , felt to be related to right heart strain in the setting of P-pulmonale related to clot burden .
His tronponin quickly trended down and he did not have EKG evidence of ischemia .
An ECHO did not reveal any wall motion abnormalities related to ischemia .
#. Hematocrit :
Dropped from 42.7 to 36 in setting of anticoagulation for saddle PE and IV fluids .
No active bleeding noted .
Pt asymptomatic .
#. L knee injury :
Given his history and physical exam , Mr. Anders presented with an injury most consistent with meniscal tear .
In order to facilitate therapy and to promote mobility , an MRI of the knee was done .
He was seen by physical therapy and will need to follow up with orthopaedics upon discharge for repeat evaluation .

Discharge Date :
01/01/2001
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 80 female with a history of diastolic function and heart failure , hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis who presents from an outside hospital with presyncope .
The patient reports dizziness intermittently times several months now increasing in frequency described as episodes where she feels faint .
The room spins with no visual changes , no loss of consciousness , no palpitations or chest pain , no shortness of breath or diaphoresis .
On the day of admission , the patient was with some friends , rose from a chair to leave and felt dizzy while ambulating , fell and hit elbow with minor head trauma .
The patient denied loss of consciousness , no bowel or bladder incontinence .
The patient was transferred to an outside hospital where she was noted to have a 50 point discrepancy in her upper extremity blood pressures , right greater than left .
This had been noted in the outpatient setting approximately one to two years prior to admission .
The patient had no mediastinal widening on chest x-ray , but was transferred to Verg Medical Center for further evaluation .
In the emergency room , the patient &apos;s temperature was 98.8 degrees , heart rate 73 , respiratory rate 18 , oxygen saturation 98% on room air .
Blood pressure in the left arm demonstrated 125/89 , blood pressure in the right arm was 177/119 .
The patient had a systolic murmur 3/6 that radiated to the carotids with a decreased left radial pulse per the emergency room .
The patient had a chest CT scan demonstrating no dissection or evidence of congestive heart failure .
She received Nitropaste , aspirin , laboratory studies and was taken to the floor for further management .
The patient denies melena , bright red blood per rectum , no emesis , or fevers or chills .
The patient has a history of anemia as per past medical history above .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Otherwise negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1 ) Cardiovascular :
The patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction .
She remained on telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time .
The patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities .
The patient was maintained on her aspirin and Lasix .
The patient &apos;s Diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on Labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160-170 systolic in her right arm .
The patient also underwent an Adenosine MIBI stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia .
At this time , the patient &apos;s presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology .
2 ) Neurological / vascular :
The discrepancy in the patient &apos;s pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis .
The patient underwent MRI / MRA of the head , neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis , proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery .
The left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon .
The patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck MRA .
MRI of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely an old right cerebellar infarct .
The patient underwent non-invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated no significant carotid disease .
The patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally .
The results of these studies suggested that the patient &apos;s symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon , and therefore , it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and / or surgical or percutaneous intervention .
A Neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient &apos;s intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure .
3 ) Orthopedic :
The patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event .
Outside hip films were obtained , but were not available for view .
Repeat hip films demonstrated a right sided pubic rami fracture , likely new .
An Orthopedics consult was obtained and the patient was encouraged to weight bear as tolerated with Physical Therapy assistance .
A bone scan was also obtained to rule out an occult hip fracture which was negative .
At the time of this dictation , the patient was able to bear weight with the assistance of Physical Therapy and a walker .
Plans were made for the patient to be discharged to Dwardmegriff Rehabilitation for rehabilitation of her rami fracture .
4 ) Gastrointestinal :
The patient had an episode of her described vertigo while lying in bed and on the monitor during which no dysrhythmia was noted .
The patient also complained of frequent vomiting at least once a day , occasionally associated with ingestion of her medications , but sometimes associated with ambulation .
The patient has a long-standing history of spontaneous emesis due to overwhelming stress or excitement .
However , the patient reports emesis in the hospital more frequently .
The patient &apos;s emesis was noted to be bilious without evidence of new or old blood .
The etiology of the patient &apos;s nausea remained unclear as she demonstrated ability to keep down many of her meals which did not suggest an anatomical lesion of her gastrointestinal tract .
The patient was started on Meclizine on December 31 , 2000 for her nausea and vertigo .
An attempt was also made to reduce the patient &apos;s large number of medications and the patient &apos;s Os-Cal , multivitamin , Lasix and Colace were discontinued .
5 ) Infectious disease :
The patient complained of some urinary incontinence and difficulty initiating urine on December 30 , 2000 .
Urinalysis demonstrated a likely urinary tract infection .
The patient was started on Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q. day times seven days for a possible nosocomial urinary tract infection .
The urine culture was pending at the time of this dictation .
6 ) Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition :
The patient had a mild increase in her BUN and creatinine during her hospitalization which promptly returned to her baseline levels with intravenous fluids .
The patient was encouraged to increase her p.o. intake ."

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 20-year-old female with no significant past medical history , who was the unrestrained passenger in a high speed rollover motor vehicle accident on 2010-06-27 .
By report , the patient was ejected from the vehicle on impact and found curled in the fetal position at the rear of the vehicle at the scene .
The vehicle was noted to be extensively damaged .
By report , the patient was noted to be awake , but confused at the scene of the accident with no memory of the incident .
She was immobilized in the C-spine collar at the scene of the accident and subsequently transported by EMS to the New England Sinai Hospital & Rehab Center Emergency Department for further management .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was evaluated by the Trauma Service in the emergency room , where she received four liters
crystalloid and four units packed red blood cells with good response .
In addition , the patient received the above-described diagnostic procedures , which demonstrated injuries limited to a posterior scalp laceration , left fractured clavicle , left fractured radius , right thigh hematoma , and right leg laceration .
The patient was subsequently admitted to the Trauma Service on 2010-06-28 under the direction of Dr. Lowery .
Given the patient 's right thigh hematoma , a duplex evaluation of the right lower extremity was performed on 2010-06-28 and demonstrated no evidence of major arterial or venous injury in the level of
the right inguinal region .
On 06-28 , the patient was also cleared for removal of her C-spine collar and deemed stable for transfer to the Orthopedic Service under the direction of Dr. Ronda Lopez .
The patient remained stable through 2010-06-29 at which point she was sent to the operating room to undergo a left radial fracture open reduction and internal fixation procedure .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and demonstrated a postoperative hematocrit of 40.9 .
Of note , the scalp and right lower leg lacerations were closed primarily by the trauma team on admission and on hospital day #1 were noted to be clean , dry , and intact .
Nonoperative treatment was elected for the patient 's left clavicular fracture .
On postoperative day #1 , 2010-06-30 , the patient was noted to be clinically stable , tolerating oral intake , and expressive of adequate amounts of urine independent of a Foley catheter .
The patient 's head wound laceration was noted to be clean and dry with intact staples .
There was no erythema or purulence .
The left clavicle was noted to have continued ecchymosis decreased from prior examination with a minor stepoff and mild tenderness to palpation decreased from prior examinations .
The left forearm dressing was noted to be in place , clean , dry , and intact with no saturation .
The patient was noted to be able to wiggle her fingers with intact flexor , extensor , abductor , and adductor function .
Mild swelling was noted in the left hand .
Sensation was intact in the median , radius , and ulnar-nerve distributions .
Fingers were warm and well perfused with capillary refill less than 3 seconds .
The patient 's right anterior tibial wound was noted to be clean , dry , and intact with sutures intact and no erythema or purulence noted .
On 06-30 , the patient was evaluated by Occupational Therapy and fitted for a left upper extremity splint .
The patient was also administered adaptive training for activities of daily life and advised regarding wound care .
In addition , the patient was also fitted with a figure-of-eight clavicular splint and instructed in its
proper use .
On 2010-07-01 , the patient was discharged from the hospital with instructions for follow up care on return to the United Kingdom ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 82 year-old right handed gentleman who has a past medical history of hypertension and tobacco use presented to the emergency room with acute change in mental status .
He was well until the evening prior to presentation to the emergency room when he complained of headache across the forehead .
On the day of presentation , he was then found by his daughter lying on his bed groaning , being relatively unresponsive and unable to speak .
The family reported one episode of vomiting at home .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to a telemetry bed and started on heparin .
Around 4:00 AM the next day , an acute decompensation in respiratory status was noted .
Lung examination at that point showed good air entry , no wheezing , coarse breath sounds throughout .
Neurologically , the patient was not following commands .
Eyes were closed .
He was moving the right arm and leg spontaneously , though less than before .
Withdrawal to pain was still present .
Both plantars were upgoing .
A blood gas at this point showed a pH of 7.49 , pO2 61 , pCO2 of 33 on 100% non-rebreather mask .
EKG showed sinus tachycardia .
The patient &apos;s temperature was 102 degrees .
A repeat CAT scan of the head was performed .
This showed continued evolution of the right posterior cerebral artery infarction now extending into the right cerebellar hemisphere .
There was also a high density adjacent to the right cerebellar infarction suggesting the presence of hemorrhage .
At this point , the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit .
An MRI and MRA of the head was arranged to evaluate the extent of his stroke and the posterior circulation .
The MRI showed infarct of the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally , the right occipital lobe , the right thalamus and bilateral pons .
The MRA of the intracranial circulation demonstrated gross patency of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally and the basilar arteries .
The left vertebral artery was not visualized .
There was a dominant right vertebral artery .
There was mildly reduced flow in the branches of the right middle cerebral artery compared to the left .
There was visualization of flow within both posterior cerebral arteries .
Clinically , the patient continued to deteriorate .
Neurosurgery was consulted , however the neurosurgeons felt that there was no surgical option , since even in the case of cerebellar swelling , there would be no improvement from decompensation .
The patient was therefore treated conservatively with fluid restriction and blood pressure management .
Heparin was discontinued because of the risk of intercerebral hemorrhage .
The aspiration pneumonia was treated with Cefotaxime and Metronidazole .
The patient &apos;s family was involved and they decided to opt for DNR / DNI in view of the poor prognosis .
The patient passed away at 6:45 AM on June 12 , 1998 ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Patient is a 64 year old white male with a past medical history of smoking , coronary artery disese , hypertension , and hypercholesterolemia with a l0 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm .
Patient presented to his private medical doctor in Gewestster with transient calf pain on walking less than fifty yards .
Abdominal aortic aneurysm was discovered on examination and patient was referred to Retelk County Medical Center .
He was admitted on 10/17/09 and echocardiogram done on 11/13/09 revealed poor left ventricular function and cardiac catheterization was done on admission which showed three vessel disease .
Patient was referred to Cardiology and underwent a three vessel coronary artery bypass graft on 11/25/09 .
His post-operative course was complicated by an E. coli urinary tract infection and transient acute renal failure with increasing creatinine .
Patient &apos;s renal function returned to normal over several days , however .
The patient &apos;s last ultrasound of his aorta revealed a l0 cm aneurysm and he presented at the time of admission for an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient was admitted and taken to the Operating Room the next day on 12/24/09 where patient underwent an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair .
In his post-operative course , patient was sent to the unit and was put on perioperative Vancomycin .
Post-operatively , patient was found to have frequent aberrant atrial premature beats and some rare ventricular premature beats .
His lungs were found to have decreased breath sounds with a question of fluid overload .
There was a question of whether to start him on Quinidine versus beta blockers .
An echocardiogram was obtained which showed moderate left ventricular dysfunction with hypokinetic and akinetic areas throughout the left and right ventricle .
Patient was loaded with Quinidine and then started on a maintenance dose .
Patient converted to normal sinus rhythm once on Quinidine .
Patient was discharged from the unit on 12/30/09 and was sent to the floor .
His digoxin was found to be elevated so his Digoxin was held for four days while levels slowly came down .
Patient was restarted on Digoxin just prior to discharge .
Patient also was found to have elevated LDH , alkaline phosphatase , and amylase prior to admission .
Lipase was within normal limits .
Ultrasound was obtained of the biliary tree which demonstrated no abnormalities .
Patient was also found to have several complaints of awaking in the middle of the night with tachypnea and some bilateral chest pain associated with breathing .
Serial EKG and CK were obtained which were negative .
A chest X-Ray demonstrated some pulmonary edema .
An arterial blood gas at that time showed pO2 of 68 , saturation of 95% , a pH of 7.5l , pCO2 of 37 , a bicarbonate of 37 , and a pCO2 of 3l with a +7 base .
Patient &apos;s chest X-Ray , as mentioned above , showed pulmonary edema .
Patient was aggressively diuresed with resolution of symptoms ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 47-year-old man with advanced stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia who was admitted for autologous bone marrow transplant as per protocol 94-055 of the Santusli Hospital .
The patient was originally diagnosed in 06/98 during a routine physical when he was noted to have a white blood cell count of 20,000 , weight loss , and swelling in his neck and groin .
He was watched after his initial diagnosis , but six months later he developed rapidly increasing leukocytosis and he became more symptomatic .
After treatment with three cycles of fludarabine he had 90% involvement of his intratrabecular space .
He was therefore treated with three cycles of fludarabine in combination with cytoxan .
After this therapy he achieved a protocol eligible minimal disease state .
However , he did have relative pancytopenia following this therapy .
He was taken to bone marrow harvest in 08/22 at which time insufficient cells were obtained to proceed .
He was returned previous to this admission for repeat bone marrow harvest and at that time he was given Neupogen prior to his harvest , and sufficient cells were not obtained to proceed with autologous bone marrow transplantation .
His most recent bone marrow biopsy revealed less than 5% of intratrabecular space involvement .
Recent CT scan showed no significant lymphadenopathy .
The spleen was within normal limits .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1 ) Oncology :
The patient was admitted on 10/22/00 and received cytoxan and total body irradiation per protocol .
Autologous bone marrow infusion occurred on 10/29/00 and was uneventful .
His post-transplant course was complicated by pain from mucositis and recalcitrant nausea and vomiting .
The patient did not tolerate antiemetics well and it was subsequently decided to avoid phenothiazides secondary to jitteryness and restless legs .
2 ) Infectious Disease :
The patient remained afebrile until day +11 when he spiked and was started on ceftazidime .
Blood cultures and urine cultures were all negative .
3 ) Heme :
The patient acquired intermittent transfusions for pancytopenia .
4 ) FEN :
The patient was unable to tolerate adequate p.o.&apos;s in the last several days .
He was well nourished so TPN was not started .
I &apos;s and O &apos;s were balanced and maintained with IV fluids ."

Nodularities in the common bile duct visualized by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was also worrisome for cholangiocarcinoma and the patient was admitted to the Blue General Surgery Service for possible surgical interventions .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. Cordano was admitted on 2009-08-17 for a replacement of transhepatic biliary drainage catheter .
At that time , cholangiogram confirmed that there was a distal stricture of the common bile duct .
An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography also demonstrated similar findings
and it is noted there was nodularity in the common bile duct which is worrisome for cholangiocarcinoma .
Therefore , the patient was taken to the Operating Room on 2009-08-24 for a Whipple procedure versus hepaticojejunostomy .
On exploration of the abdomen revealed significant nodularity of the liver indicating of advanced cirrhosis .
Intraoperative frozen section of the distal and proximal common bile duct in the
region nodularity , which is identified previously by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , and regional lymph nodes were all sent to pathology .
They were all negative for malignancy and therefore a hepaticojejunostomy
was performed .
Cholangiogram on postoperative day number two showed no evidence of leakage at the anastomosis site .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and he was sent to the floor in stable condition .
The patient 's postoperative course was notable for an elevation in white blood cell count peaking at 30.0 on postoperative day number two .
He was given Unasyn for empiric antibiotic treatment .
At the time , blood , urine and bile was sent for culture , which were all negative .
A chest x-ray was also negative for any pneumonia .
Postoperatively , Mr. Cordano also suffered from low urine output ranges between 25 to 30 cc per hour .
Fractional excretion of sodium was less than 1% suggesting a prerenal etiology .
The sodium creatinine peaked at 2.0 and the patient was treated with boluses of intravenous fluid and intravenous albumin infusion was also administered .
He responded well to this regimen and made adequate urine output .
At the same time , the patient also developed distentions of the abdomen consistent with accumulation of ascitic fluid .
He also had significant lower extremity and scrotum edema .
On postoperative day number eight , the patient 's oxygen saturation dropped to 85% on room air and he was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for fluid management .
Chest x-ray and sputum culture obtained at the time were negative and the patient was treated with 100% nonrebreather which improved his oxygenation .
While he is in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit , paracentesis was performed and it
revealed greater than 24,000 white blood cell count in the ascites which is consistent with SVT .
He was given Zosyn for empiric treatment .
Gram stain and culture of the ascites failed to identify any organism .
He was weaned from oxygen requirement and was continued on normal saline boluses and
intravenous albumin for treatment of prerenal azotemia .
Somatostatin and midodrine were also given for this condition and he also received packed red blood cells .
On postoperative day number ten , the patient returned to the floor with improved renal function and without oxygen requirement .
The somatostatin and the midodrine were discontinued and the regimen of Lasix and spironolactone was started for diuresis .
His creatinine levels trended toward normal and the fractional excretion of sodium also increased indicating a resolution of the prerenal kidney failure .
On postoperative day number 17 , the patient was discharged .
At the time he took good po .
He has a PICC line in place for continued treatment with Rocephin and he will have a visiting nurse to help him to administer these medications .
While in the hospital , the patient received initial work-up including echocardiogram , electrocardiogram and serology studies to be listed for liver transplant ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 56 year old man with history of hypercholesterolemia and type II diabetes mellitus .
He has a recent history of dyspnea on exertion on exertional chest pain which has increased over the last several weeks and is relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin .
On 2016-06-26 , he had a positive exercise tolerance test .
Cardiac catheterization at the end of October revealed a dilated aortic root to 4.4 cm and 80% stenosis of the mid left anterior descending at the bifurcation involving the diagonal branch , 70% stenoses of the left circumflex and oblique marginal artery and 90% stenosis of the posterior descending artery .
His atrioventricular valve gradient was 27 with an AV surface area of .91 .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Review of systems shows that the patient denies any orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
He has no bleeding or clotting problems .
Juanita does not feel any palpitations .
He does not have wheezing , claudication or gastrointestinal bleeding .
Nor does he have any history of stroke like symptoms .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted to the cardiac surgery service for an elected Bental procedure with homograft and coronary artery bypass graft .
Once consent and preoperative evaluation was complete , he was taken to the operating room .
Please refer to the previously dictated operative note of 2016-12-30 by Dr. Lawrence .
Briefly , the patient was taken to the operating room to repair his critical aortic stenosis , his coronary artery disease and his significantly dilated ascending aortic aneurysm .
The procedure was an aortic valve replacement with a tissue valve , a coronary artery bypass graft procedure where five grafts were performed .
The left internal mammary artery was connected to the proximal left anterior descending and saphenous vein grafts were connected to the posterior descending artery , diagonal branch , obtuse marginal and distal left anterior descending .
Finally , a super coronary arch graft was implanted .
This was a .................... graft .
Cardiopulmonary bypass time was 234 minutes .
His aorta was cross clamped for 168 minutes .
He had pharmacologic circulatory arrest for 18 minutes .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the unit , intubated on Milrinone , Levophed and Propofol drips .
The rest of the hospital stay can be discussed in terms of system based approach .
Pulmonary :
The patient remained intubated until postoperative day number five .
After that , the patient had no major problems with his lungs .
His oxygen saturations remained good and he did not require supplemental oxygen more than a couple of days after his extubation .
He was sent to the floor from the cardiac surgery recovery unit on postoperative day number seven .
After an extended stay for hemodynamic monitoring and pressor support to maintain his perfusion .
Neurologic :
The major neurologic event of this hospital course was that the patient was slow to awake after his Propofol drip was discontinued .
Because of his confusion , a neurology consult was obtained and subsequent radiographic imaging revealed chronic appearing infarcts in the right occipital lobe as well as both cerebellar hemispheres , suggestive of more chronic infarcts , as well as an area in the left corona radiata , adjacent to the left lateral ventricle which may or may not be an acute infarct .
This was seen on the CAT scan on postoperative day number one , 12-31 .
As the patient became more awake , he still remained somewhat confused and a little bit out of it .
In addition , he was noted to have a right sided hemiplegia .
Over his postoperative course , Mr. Douglass has gradually been able to utilize more and more of his right side and with the assistance of physical therapy and occupational therapy , he has 4 to 5 + strength in his right hand and arm and about 4 + strength in his right leg .
He is able to walk about the floor on the days prior to discharge , with the assistance of the physical therapist and nurses .
In addition , Mr. Douglass is given Trazodone to help him sleep at night .
A psychiatric consult was also obtained due to his mental status and confusion postoperatively but his psychiatric issues are mostly related to his neurologic insults and he has no distinctive psychiatric disorder , except for perhaps postoperative delirium .
Cardiovascularly , the patient did extremely well following the surgery .
The Levophed drip was continued until postoperative day number one .
Milrinone was continued until postoperative day number three , at which point he was having good enough cardiac output that he did not need these drips to help maintain his blood pressure anymore .
He has remained without any chest pain following this procedure and his sternal wound is clean , dry and intact at the end of the procedure .
In addition , he has hypertension , for which he receives Metoprolol and he has hypercholesterolemia , for which he receives nothing at this time .
Pulmonary :
The patient remained intubated until postoperative day number five .
He was diuresed and was soon saturating very well on room air .
Gastrointestinal :
The patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease , for which he has been receiving Zantac as an inpatient .
We will put him back on his Nexium .
In addition , over the last couple of days prior to discharge , the patient did appear a little bit icteric .
Liver function tests were obtained and they were slightly elevated liver function tests and ALT was 44 , AST was 34 ; alkaline phosphatase was 199 , within normal limits .
Total bilirubin was 2.8 .
Amylase was 108 and lipase was 213 .
A right upper quadrant ultrasound did not reveal any gallstones or common bile duct dilatation indicative of cholecystitis or cholelithiasis .
In addition , the patient did have slightly elevated blood sugars over the last couple of days and has required an insulin sliding scale and basal insulin to maintain his blood sugars at a more appropriate level .
The ideal blood sugar levels for Mr. Douglass in this postoperative period should be less than 140 .
Please stay on top of the sliding scale so that the patient can keep a euglycemic level .
Hematologic :
The patient , during this admission , required transfusion of three units of packed red blood cells to maintain adequate hematocrit .
At the time of discharge , Mr. Norman hematocrit is at 40.7 .
Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition :
The patient did receive a significant amount of diuresis postoperatively and is well below his baseline with weight , most likely because of his inability to eat because of his stroke .
Once he was coherent enough , the patient was evaluated by the swallow team who
declared him at first an aspiration risk .
As Mr. Douglass has improved from his initial stroke , he has become more lucid
and is less of an aspiration risk .
On 01-12 , one day prior to discharge , he was cleared by the swallow team to eat
a diet as he wishes .
He is going out on a cardiac healthy , diabetic diet , as tolerated with Boost supplements .
Infectious disease :
The patient had positive blood and urine cultures on 01-05 for history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus , which was pan sensitive .
He was started on Oct. 25 for this bug .
On 01-08 , the patient 's central venous line was discontinued .
The catheterization tip also grew out Serratia .
On the 16th , a urine culture was obtained and did grow out greater than 100,000 colonies of E. coli which was intermittently resistant to Ciprofloxacin .
He was started on Bactrim for that .
Please continue Mr. David Montero for one month to fight his blood borne infection , to prevent seeding of his aortic graft and continue Bactrim for ten days after discharge to treat the E. coli in his urine ."

He returns from the nursing home with fever , leukocytosis , and azotemia .
PRESENT ILLNESS :
Briefly , the patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , ethanol abuse , chronic pleural effusions , and chronic renal insufficiency .
He presented to Gaanvantsir on 04-17-92 with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea .
Workup revealed ischemic bowel secondary to Celiac and SMA stenoses .
The patient underwent an angioplasty of his SMA from 90-20% residual .
The patient was also found to have gram negative rod sepsis with blood cultures times two growing E. coli and B. fragilis .
The patient was treated with ampicillin , gentamicin , and Flagyl .
The patient was readmitted on 5-21-91 with a falling hematocrit from 36 to 22 , mild congestive heart failure , and guaiac positive stool .
The colonoscopy and upper gastrointestinal series were negative .
The patient was given two units of packed red blood cells and H2 blockers .
His hematocrit was 31 on discharge .
His hematocrit was 31 on discharge .
On 6-12-91 the patient was admitted to Ingtermst.gay Health Center with fever , hypertension , and diarrhea .
The BUN and creatinine equalled 128/8.6 , CO2 equaled 12 .
The patient was treated with intravenous fluids , Kefzol , gentamicin , Vancomycin , and he was transferred to Gaanvantsir .
He was hospitalized from 6-12-91 to 7-9-91 with a prolonged course notable for :
1) Serratia urosepsis treated with ceftizoxime .
2) Azotemia presumed secondary to sepsis and dehydration , creatinine decreased to 2.1 with intravenous fluids and antibiotics .
Renal ultrasound was negative for abscess orhydronephrosis .
3) Loculated pleural effusions .
Thoracentesis revealed a pH of 7.18 , glucose 52 , white blood cell count 200 ; evaluated by thoracic surgery , no chest tube placed .
4) C. difficile colitis with white blood cell count rising to 51,000 , treated with intravenous and p.o. Flagyl .
C. difficile was negative times three prior to discharge .
The patient went to his nursing home on 7-9-91 but the next day he developed a temperature to 102.4 degrees , diarrhea , and orthostasis and he was transferred back to Gaanvantsir .
The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit with question of sepsis .
White blood cell count was 40,000 with left shift .
The BUN was 35 , creatinine 4.3 .
Urinalysis had 5-10 white blood cells and 2+ bacteria .
The patient underwent thoracentesis without evidence of empyema .
He was treated with intravenous fluids and intravenous antibiotics with ceftizoxime , gentamicin , and Flagyl .
He was also started on p.o. Vancomycin for question C. difficile colitis .
He is now transferred to the medicine service for further care .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Colitis .
The patient has a history of ischemic bowel status post SMA Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty with recent admission for gram negative rod urosepsis complicated by C. difficile colitis .
The patient received a full course of Flagyl and was C. difficile toxin negative times three prior to transfer .
He now returns with fever , rising white count , diarrhea , and dehydration .
Initially treated with intravenous ceftizoxime , gentamicin , and Flagyl for presumed sepsis , either with urine or bowel source .
He was also started on p.o. Vancomycin .
Blood cultures and urine cultures came back negative .
Stool for C. difficile returned positive .
The diagnosis , therefore , was relapsed C. difficile colitis .
Intravenous antibiotics were discontinued and the patient was continued on p.o. Vancomycin .
He improved clinically with defervescence , decreased white blood cell count to 10,000 with resolution of left shift , and some decrease in abdominal distention on exam .
An abdominal CAT scan revealed thickened bowel wall and thumb printing , primarily involving the cecum and right colon greater than the left , consistent with C. difficile colitis .
The diagnosis of recurrent bowel ischemia , however , was not ruled out and this will continue to be a concern in the future .
The patient was initially n.p.o. and was then advanced to clear liquids which he tolerated .
He will be advanced to soft solids prior to discharge .
2. Azotemia .
The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine 1.8-2 .
Creatinine had risen to 4.3 on admission presumed secondary to sepsis and dehydration .
With intravenous hydration the BUN and creatinine fell to 12/1.9 which is within normal limits for this patient .
The abdominal CAT scan showed no evidence of hydronephrosis orrenal abscess .
3. Mental status .
The patient was alert and oriented throughout the admission ; however , by personality , he is somewhat cantankerous and demanding of the nurses .
He was written for Haldol 1 mg p.o b.i.d. p.r.n. to help with this problem ."

History of Present Illness :
47 female with h/o HCV cirrhosis compocated by encephalopathy , ascites , and h/o portal vein thrombosis ( right anterior portal vein ) and portalcaval shunt ( reversed flow in main portal vein ) presents from liver clinic with increasing abdominal girth .
She also described sob , nausea , worsening lower ext edema .
She denied abd pain , fevers , chills .
She was admitted for a large volume paracentesis but her INR on admission was 3.8 .
She received 4units of FFP which decreased her INR to 2.2 and then 2 more units during the tap .
She then had 6L of non-bloody ascitic fluid removed without complication .
She received 36gm of albumin following the tap .
Her BP on admission was 120/70 and remained stable following the tap .
Over the next several hours , pt complained of abd pain but this resolved on its own without medication .
In the am , she was found to have a hct of 24 , down from 32 and plts 35 , down from 72 .
She received 2 units of plts and 1 unit of PRBC s.
Her BP was then noted to be decreased at 80/40 which improved mildly to 90/30 with 1.5L of NS .
Temp noted to be low at 94 and she was placed on bear hugger which improved temp to 96.7 .
Her mental status also had decreased from admission and her urine output was minimal , 225cc over the past 12 hours .
Creatinine this am was 1.9 from 0.9 yesterday .
Previous hospital course ( per H&P ):
She was recently hospitalised from 02-23 / 03-04 for abdominal discomfort at which time she underwent paracentesis that ruled out SBP and relieved her abdominal pain .
She also underwent US that revealed patent portal and hepatic vessels .
While her discharge summary maintains that she was continued on Furosemide / Spirinolactone / Propranolol , the patient did not receive any scripts on discharge and as a result did not take these medications .
Also , due to worsening renal function , she was started on octreotide / midodrine / albumin for hepatorenal ssyndrome ( Cr 3.3 at its worst ) which resolved prior to her discharge .
The hospitalisation was also significant for mild DIC for which she received cryoglobulins and UTI (+ Enterococcus and + Klebsiella ).
She received a 7 day course of amoxicillin for which Enterococcus was sensitive but Klebsiella unknown .
Brief Hospital Course :
A/P : 48 yo morbidly obese woman with HCV cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy , esophageal varices and partial vein thrombosis ( but no hx of SBP ) presents with increasing abdominal girth likely secondary to ascites .
Admitted for diagnostic / therapeutic paracentesis and then transferred to the ICU for hypotension , confusion and anemia .
# Liver cirrhosis : MELD score of 34 on admission .
Pt became more encephalopathic during her hospital course .
She was not a transplant candidate due to her obesity .
A family meeting was held on hospital day #4 which included the pt 's closest family members , her hepatologist , Dr. Steidl , her PCP , Dr. Popoff and the ICU team .
After it was explained that the pt 's prognosis was very poor given that she was not a transplant candidate , the 
decision was made by the family and the medical team to withdraw care .
The pt was made comfortable and she expired several hours later .
# Recurrent ascites : On the medical floor , pt had a large volume paracentesis ( 6 liters ) followed by replacement with albumin .
She had no evidence of SBP .
# Hypotension : Pt became hypotensive following the large volume paracentesis despite replacement with albumin .
This was thought to be 04-09 the large volume tap verses sepsis though she had no other evidence of sepsis .
She was placed on pressors to maintain a MAP > 55 .
Once the decision was made to withdraw care , the pressors were discontinued .
# Anemia : Hct dropped following the tap and there was concern for bleed into her abdomen .
She received one unit of PRBC s.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of bleed .
Her hematocrit remained stable at 24-26 following the acute drop.
# ARF : Creatinine has increased from 0.9 on admission to 1.9 on admission to ICU .
Urine lytes with Na of 10 indicating either pre-renal or hepatorenal .
Fluid challenge with 36gm of albumin , one unit of PRBCs and 2L of NS .
Will check creatinine this afternoon .
Pt previously diagnosed with hepatorenal and was started on midodrine , octreotide and albumin ; these were 
continued .

History of Present Illness :
HPI: Pt is a 71 y/o male with h/o dm2 , cad s/p cabg , DVT/PE on long term anti-coagulation , ulcerative colitis on Asacol presents with brbpr starting at 9am of the morning of admission .
He 'd been having lower abdominal pain for approximately the past week , a symptom for which he 's been admitted in the past .
His PCP had recently started ciprofloxacin for a UTI . 
At 9am the morning of admission he passed a large , bloody bowel movement and came to the Michael . There , his vitals were intially stable with a hct of 36.7 , though he was felt to be hypovolemic and this hemoconcentrated ; his previous hct was 39 about five months ago .
He refused an NG lavage .
Although an initial DRE showed only clot , he later passed a large , bloody bowel movement , and his bp nadired to the low 90's but rested there only transiently and easily rebounded to the 130's-140's with fluid ; he then went to angiography for a tagged RBC scan where they found and embolized two vessels to the sigmoid colon .
His HCT had dropped from 36.7 to 30.8 despite 2U PRBC and 3 U FFP .
Is called out of the FICU as has been been HD and stable HCT .
Currently denies CP , SOB , abd pain or continued BRBPR .
Brief Hospital Course :
Initial A/P :
71 y/o male with dm2 , cad , chf , uc presents with one week of lower abdominal pain and 2 episodes of brpbr on the day of admission .
# BRBPR -- The patient was in the intensive care unit given his lower GI bleed .
An angiography showed bleeding in two vessels off of the Minnie supplying the sigmoid that were succesfully embolized .
The patient was transfused from a Hct 29 to 34 on the day of discharge .
His coumadin was held during his stay given his acute bleed but restarted per his PCP with the guidance of GI on the day of discharge .
- The patient underwent a flex sigmoidoscopy on Friday , 11-02 , which showed old blood in the rectal vault but no active source of bleeding .
Given this , it was advised that the patient have a colonoscopy to rule out further bleeding .
- The patient had a colonoscopy on Monday 11-05 but unfortunately , was unable to complete the study as his bowel prep was inadequate .
Therefore , he had a repeat colonoscopy on 11-06 which showed expected mucosal signs of moderate ulcerative colitis , no polyps , w/ 8 mm ulcer at junction of distal descending colon and sigmoid colon .
- Biopsies were obtained during his colonoscopy and he should follow up with gastroenterology for the results .
# Ulcerative colitis -- The patient 's Asacol was originally held but restarted the day prior to discharge per GI .
# CAD/CHF - The patient was restarted on his home regimen prior to discharge as it was held temporarily given his acute GI bleed .
The exception is that per his PCP , Jason aspirin will be held for 2 weeks given that he was restarted on coumadin with 
his risk of bleeding .
# DM-2 -- The patient was maintained on his home insulin regimen .
# h/o DVT/PE :
Coumadin was initially held .
It was unclear at first as to why the patient required life-long anticoagulation .
After discussing this with his PCP , Leon was clear that the patient had had recurrent DVTs and ultimately a PE and his PCP felt strongly that he required long-term anticoagulation .
His goal INR should be 1.6-2.0 . If bleeding continues to occur , consider V. Winchester filter .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with PBSE and CCSS support ending June 1994 .
She was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control .
The patient first presented in October 1991 with a tender right axillary mass .
A mammogram done in November 1990 was negative .
However , mammography repeated in October 1991 showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma .
Fine needle aspiration on October 23 , 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters .
Staging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray .
Bone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally .
Dr. Berca Gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on November 4 , 1991 .
The right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , Grade III out of III infiltrating ductal carcinoma .
The margins were free of tumor , but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma .
Furthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer .
The left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion .
Estrogen receptor was 0% by ERICA .
The patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage .
Therefore she had a Stage III-A adenocarcinoma of the breast .
Since she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy .
The patient was treated with CMSAP , which is Cytoxan , Methotrexate , Leukovoranrescue , 5-FU , Adriamycin and Prednisone for four cycles .
There were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression .
However , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion .
ABGs showed a pO2 of 79 , pH 7.44 , pO2 33 .
Chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates .
The differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , Mycoplasma , Chlamydia .
Basically in December 1993 , she returned to the Hem / Onc Clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied .
Although she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver CT were negative for metastatic disease .
She was thus started on a Protocol of high dose chemotherapy with GCSF and peripheral stem cell support .
Complications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis .
She also developed Klebsiella UTI after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy .
It was treated with gent and Cipro .
Re-staging done in April 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis .
In May 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and Velban and Methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions .
In mid May she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a UTI with blood clots in the urine .
The patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 .
She has also been having diarrhea since November and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting .
We will include a very thorough HPI with this dictation that was done by Dr. Wedleung ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 80 year old female with breast cancer , status post lumpectomy / radiation therapy / Tamoxifen ( 2000 ) , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , multiple urinary tract infections who presents with a four day prodrome of dry cough , rhinorrhea , coryza , malaise , chills , headache , decreased p.o. intake , loose bowel movements with diarrhea and no blood , decreased urine output , no sick contacts , had flu shot this year .
In the Emergency Department , she had labile blood pressure with systolic blood pressure in the 80 s .  
Her usual is systolic blood pressure in the 120 s , this was despite two liters of intravenous fluids and she was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring for possible early sepsis .
The Intensive Care Unit course was notable for initially receiving broad spectrum antibiotics as well as a white blood cell count of 11.0 with 15 bands .
She was ultimately changed to Levaquin for a possible early pneumonia pending cultures .
The Intensive Care Unit course was also notable for negative chest x-ray , two units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 24.0 with appropriate bump in her hematocrit and no evidence of bleeding , stable blood pressure despite a net fluid balance of negative 2.5 liters .
No central access was needed .
The sepsis protocol was aborted .
Also of note , her liver function tests had been normal .
Random cortisol was 17 and her DFA was positive for influenzae A with a viral culture pending at the time of discharge .
Blood and urine cultures were no growth at the time of discharge as well .
She also had a right lower extremity noninvasive ultrasound that was negative for deep venous thrombosis .

History of Present Illness :
_62 year-old status-post gastric bypass and laprascopic cholecystectomy 7 weeks prior to admission who presented with fever , chills , and left lower extemity redness .
The patient has a history of multiple hospitalizations for lower extremity cellulitis and noted that his symptoms and the appearance of his left leg mirrored previous episodes .
He denied recent trauma to the area or travel .
Review of systems was significant only for painful urination over the past few days and a reduction in urine output .
He denied chest pain , shortness of breath , palpitations , abdominal pain , N/V , penile discharge .
Brief Hospital Course :
This 62 year-old obese male was admitted with cellulitis and presumed bacteremia .
In the John , he was found to be in hypotensive atrial fibrillation .
The patient was admitted to the Medical ICU where his hypotension was managed with IVF hydration and he was maintained on a diltiazam drip for atrial fibrillation .
After his heart rate was controlled , he was transitioned to oral medications and transferred to the medicine service .
1. Cellulitis / Bacteremia
Review of the medical record revealed several previous admissions for cellulitis and bacteremia .
Blood cultures on this admission and were positive for Beta streptococcus Group B .
The patient had previous episodes of the same infection , with lower extremity cellulitis the likely source .
A left lower extremity ultrasound was negative for deep venous thrombosis .
The patient was too large to have a CTA .
He was initially treated with vancomycin and zosyn while awaiting culture results .
Once the organism was identified , he was transitioned to a regimen of intravenous penicillin and oral levofloxacin , which had successfully treated the infection during his most recent admission 1 year prior .
He completed 7 days of levofloxacin and had a PICC line placed to facilitate a 2 week course of IV Penicillin .
2. Atrial fibrillation
The patient 's development of atrial fibrillation was believed to be secondary to infection and structural heart disease .
It was initially managed with intravenous diltiazam , and it was later managed with metoprolol and anticoagulation .
A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a mildly dilated and elongated left atrium , with a markedly dilated right atrium .
He had occasional episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation that were controlled with responded to IV metoprolol .
However , his rate proved difficult to control despite metoprolol and diltiazam .
The EP service was consulted and recommended transesophageal echocardiogram and cardioversion .
The TEE was negative for thrombus and the patient was successfully cardioverted to normal sinus rhythm with ibutilide .
He was subsequently started on amiodarone and is scheduled to complete a 10 week course .
EKG before discharge showed mild QT prolongation and no effect from amiodarone .
EKG and LFTs should be monitored by his PCP , William given the high dose of amiodarone he will receive .
3. FEN
He was followed by the nutrition team throughout his admission and their recommendations were followed .
He demonstrated several asymptomatic electrolyte deficiecies ; these were likely due to inadequate absorption following his surgery and he responded well to repletion .
Vitamin D and parathyroid tests were pending at the time of discharge .
The patient was discharged to Kindred Park View Specialty Hospital of Springfield Rehabilitation Hospital in good condition .
He was sent with a King of Hearts monitor and scheduled for follow-up with cardiology and his primary care physician ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Kacholera Junk was a 34 year old gentleman with no significant past medical history except for a history of of intravenous drug abuse .
He was status post a rehabilitation hospitalization at the Raya Ma Den Erinmarg Hospital with a recent recrudescence of his drug abuse .
He was admitted to the Sephsandpot Center on the morning of 4/9 and was subsequently transferred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for further care .
The patient was apparently well until one day prior to admission .
His family reports that he had worked that day .
He relates using large doses of Cocaine and Heroin early in the morning on the day of admission .
At 3:00 a.m. on the day of admission he was found by the emergency medical technicians &quot; crawling on all fours &quot; , confused , and combative outside his home .
He gave an equivocal history of fevers and chills on the days prior to admission .
Bystanders report that he was assaulted about 20 minutes earlier and the nature of the assault was not known .
He was taken to the Sephsandpot Center where he was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 105/85 , tachycardic with a heart rate to 186 , aneuric , hyperthermic , with a temperature to 105 degrees F , and progressively more confused .
His chest x-ray was clear .
He was treated with Dopamine for hypertension and Inderal for tachycardia .
He received two amps of Narcan .
He received one gram of Ceftriaxone intravenously after blood cultures were drawn .
His initial arterial blood gas at the Sephsandpot Center revealed a p02 of 76 , pC02 14 , and a pH of 7.44 on room air .
He was then transferred via Med Flight to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
He denied any history of recent travel .
Toxicology screen at Sephsandpot Center revealed Cocaine and Quinine .
Shortly after his arrival to that hospital he had been intubated for a respiratory rate of 60 .
He required medical paralysis for this .
He was reported to have a seizure , although the nature of this was unclear , and received Valium for this .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with the diagnosis of Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , shock , hepatic failure , pancreatitis , and thrombocytopenia in the setting of Cocaine intoxication .
He was accepted at the Vo Yd Burgsygu Hospital Center Intensive Care Unit and his hospital course will be reviewed by problems .
1-Rhabdomyolysis .
The patient had massive Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis .
This resulted in tremendous third spacing of fluid and persistent intervascular hypovolemia .
The patient &apos;s creatinine ______________ kinase peaked at 56,160 with negative MB percentages .
The aldolase was positive at 142 .
This was further complicated by hypocalcemia which resulted in mild electrocardiographic abnormalities .
The patient &apos;s urine was alkalinized with intravenous bicarbonate to maximize the myoglobin secretion .
The patient &apos;s urine output was further augmented by adding Dopamine .
Nevertheless , the patient &apos;s renal failure continued to progress .
Over the course of the hospitalization his CK fell in the serum .
Much of his diffuse pain was felt to be due to this massive rhabdomyolysis .
2-Renal failure .
The creatinine was 4.4 on admission and peaked at 10.5 on the 15th .
The urinalysis revealed 4+ albumin with marked occult blood .
Peritoneal dialysis was instituted on 4/11 after a Tenckhoff catheter was placed by Drs. Freierm , Le , and Round .
Subsequently his creatinine rose for three days and then stabilized at 10 .
He continued to make minimal urine throughout the hospitalization .
3-Disseminated intravascular coagulation .
On admission the patient &apos;s prothrombin time was 27.7 with a partial thromboplastin time of greater than 100 and a d-dimer positive at 8 with a fibrinogen of 69 .
He went on to develop profound thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage .
The patient was supported with abundant use of fresh frozen plasma , cryoprecipitate , platelets , and packed red blood cells .
His DIC was further complicated by hepatic failure which resulted in poor endogenous production of clotting factors and he remained fresh frozen plasma dependent .
4-Septic shock .
The patient remained pressor dependent throughout his hospitalization .
He was maintained variously on Levophed , Dobutamine , Dopamine , and ultimately Epinephrine for blood pressure support .
Hemodynamic monitoring revealed low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output .
He had multiple sources of infection including his sinuses , lungs , and multiple lines .
This will be discussed below .
Further he had massive muscle necrosis and hepatic failure .
An echocardiogram on 4/12 revealed a dilated left ventricle which was diffusely mildly hypokinetic with no vegetations .
His ejection fraction was 55% .
On 4/16 the pulmonary artery catheter was placed which revealed a wedge pressure of 8 , cardiac index of 4.5 , and an SVR of 5.8 .
5-Hepatic failure .
His SGPT on admission was 2,520 with a peak at 7,680 on hospital day two .
He had complete loss of synthetic and conjugation function of the liver with rising bilirubin and falling albumin with dependence on transfusion for support of his prothrombin time .
He was seen in consultation by the GI Service and the Liver Transplantation Service .
Given his multiple other medical problems , the direness of his situation , and his ongoing substance abuse at the time of admission he was deemed not to be a candidate for a liver transplantation .
6-Cocaine intoxication .
Serum Cocaine was positive 6-12 hours ingestion at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
Further , at Ceanotsit Ortgold Center his serum toxicology screens were positive .
This is thought to be the insighting cause of his massive rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure .
7-Pneumonia .
The patient developed two pneumonias with two separate organisms .
The first was Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus , treated with Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin .
He subsequently developed a staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was treated with Vancomycin , dosed to levels appropriate for his renal failure .
He was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who advised us on antibiotic choices daily .
8-Pancreatitis .
The amylase on admission was 279 with a lipase of 161 .
Although not fully this may have contributed to his hypocalcemia and volume requirements .
9-Catheter tip infections .
The patient grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus from the femoral lines which were placed during his profound hypertension .
These were treated with Vancomycin .
10-Anemia .
The patient &apos;s hematocrit was 33% on admission and fell to 28 requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization .
11-Coma .
The patient , although initially minimally responsive , went on to develop a deep comatose state .
A CT scan on admission revealed no evidence of hemorrhage though he did have sphenoid sinusitis .
The lumbar puncture and sinus exploration were unable to be performed given the patient &apos;s persistent coagulopathy .
The patient was treated empirically with Nafcillin and Ceftriaxone for meningitis and sinusitis .
Further complicating this was his profound liver failure with rising ammonias and hepatic encephalopathy .
Despite maximal supports the patient continued to be hypotensive .
Mid-way through his hospital course he developed trilobar pneumonia and this was probably complicated further by adult respiratory distress syndrome and the multi-organ system failure syndrome .
The patient remained mechanically ventilated throughout his hospitalization .
Nevertheless , he developed refractory hypoxemia , hypotension , and ultimately the patient died despite total life support ."

History of Present Illness :
30-year-old woman with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary .
At ChelseaWomens ' , about 04-25 , she developed pseudomonal urosepsis and vaginal bleeding from tumor extension/anti-coagulation .
She was transfered to AttleboroHospital after an arrest .
Her course was complicated by post-hypotensive coma as well as subarachnoid hemorrhages and intraparenchymal bleeds .
Neurologists at RIH felt she had a poor prognosis , but communication between the medical team and family was strained and transfer was arranged to Mediplex Rehab Hospital for a second opinion .
Her outside course in more detail:
Patient transferred from Women and Infants Hospital to RI Hospital 2016-04-25 with weaknes , vag bleeding x several days , fever 102.5 , hypotension , hypoxic 84% on 4L NC , tachypnic to 30 , with labs significant for lactate 6.3 , wbc <1.0 , plt 9 , hgb 8.9 , and INR greater than lab threshold .
Intubated for airway protection ( ABG 7.39/26.5/73.6 ) and placed on levophed . .
Placed on Reynolds/vanc/fluc/gentamicin for neutropenic fever and thrush initially .
IVC filter placed 04-26 .
CT abdomen consistent with large necrotic pelvic mass - not sampled 02-12 coagulopathy .
04-27 results from Blood Cx from W+I :
04-24 PICC Bld Cx : pseudomonas Diaz to zosyn , cipro , cefepime , Tardugno -- staph epi- Gray to vanc
04-24 Peripheral Bld Cx : pseudomonas as above
04-24 Urine Cx : pseudomonas as above
Abx changed to vanc , zosyn , cipro , fluc , azith .
Pressors weaned off by 04-27 .
Completed 7 days of vanc/fluc , 13/14 days of cipro/zosyn .
Continued to have recurrent fevers . .
Seen by Urology who did not change stents given severe coagulopathy and worsening renal function .
Found to be in DIC and supported with daily blood products .
Seen by heme and GCSF started .
Despite aggressive blood product repletion patient poorly responsive 02-12 alloimmunization .
Plt count 1 on 2016-04-29 .
Supported on TPN for nutrition then switched to tube feeds .
Developed renal failure with Cr peak of 2.9.
Seen by renal who felt was c/w ATN . .
Head CT done 05-04 with bilateral SAH and L temporal parenchymal hematoma .
Also with multiple masses consistent with metastasis .
Placed on Dilantin .
Neurosurgery consulted .
Felt secondary to low platelets with no surgical intervention indicated . .
Mult family meetings given poor prognosis .
Initially decided not to escilate care and make DNR 05-05 .
Then progressed to withdrawal of care 05-06 with plan to extubate 05-07 .
However there was dissent among neurologists about patient 's ability to recover from the SAH while awaiting family members and the patient was changed to full code .
Given 48 hours off sedation with out change in mental status ( last morphine was 2016-05-07 ) .
Transferred to Mediplex Rehab Hospital for further work up . .
On arrival to the FICU the patient was intubated and non-sedated .
Brief Hospital Course :
30 yo F with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary who presented to OSH 04-25 with pseudomonal urosepsis , vaginal bleeding from tumor extension/anti-coagulation .
Course complicated by sub arachnoid hemorrhages and intraparenchymal bleeds as well as potential hypotensive brain injury with poor prognosis per neurology .
Transferred here for second opinion on poor prognosis . .
# Neurologic - The patient was seen by the Neurology consult service and underwent MRI head which revealed lesions suspicious for metastases , possible hemorrhages , and findings consistent with hypoxic brain injury .
EEG was performed and revealed encephalopathy .
The patient 's neurologic exam ( performed after sedation removed >48 hours ) revealed intact brainstem function without evidence of higher cortical activity .
She had some metabolic abnormalities which were corrected ( hypernatremia , hyperphosphatemia ) , but neurologic exam was unchanged .
A family meeting on 2016-05-13 was held and these findings communicated with the patient 's family .
Final neurologic assessment was that the patient was unlikely to regain meaningful neurologic functioning .
At the request of her family , she will be transferred closer to her home in Wyoming , to Women and Infants hospital . .
# Respiratory Failure - Pt arrived on pressure support ventilation , which was changed to Assist control to make patient more comfortable .
She was originally intubated for airway protection , and it is felt she could likely be weaned from the ventilator although she would be extremely high risk for aspiration .
Due to family request to move patient to a hospital closer to home , she will remain intubated until transfer , with plan to extubate upon arrival to Women and Infants hospital with initiation of full palliative care and compliance of DNI status . .
# Fevers/Infection - Per outside hospital records , the patient grew pseudomonas from blood and urine .
At OSH , she was treated with 7 days of vancomycin , as well as 13 days ( of 14-day planned course ) of Ciprofloxacin and Zosyn .
She was intially continued on Cipro/Zosyn .
CXR 05-11 revealed ? pneumonia vs atelectasis at the R lung base .
Continues to spike fever .
Could have still seeding of nephrostomy tube .
Urology at OSH against pulling tube because coagulopathy and may not be able to replace .
Fevers also may be from head bleed , cancer , or drug .
She was continued on zosyn and vancomycin to complete a >14 day course .
She continued to have fevers .
Antibiotics were discontinued on 05-15 .
No further infectious course was identified and the fevers may have been due to underlying malignant process . .
# Squamous Cell Cancer - unknown primary .
The patient was seen by the oncology consult service who contacted her outside hematologist Dr. Pauling .
Upon discussion with him it was noted that the patient had progression of her disease after systemic therapy with topotecan and cisplatin .
She then proceed to XRT with cisplatin which she was unable to tolerate this secondary to thrombocytopenia ( 40-50K ) .
Given this we were unable to offer her additional therapy. Hematology/Oncology service at Mediplex Rehab Hospital confirmed her grim prognosis and expective survival in terms of weeks to months with no further available treatment . .
# h/o DVT - patient with head bleed which is contraindication to anti-coagulation .
IVC filter in place .
Patient was on pneumoboots while in hospital . .
# Hypernatremia - Improved from OSH .
Total body volume overloaded .
Water Deficit 2.5 L .
She was continued on free H20 boluses and D5 1/2 NS and corrected . .
# Acute Renal Failure - stable , likely 02-12 hypotension leading to ATN that is slowly improving . .
# Access - R IJ changed sterilly over wire 05-01 .
# FEN - tube feeds are held in route in anticipation of extubation . . .
# Code Status :
After multiple discussion with family and the doctor accepting the patient at Women and Infants Hospital ( Dr . Pauling ) at RI .
She was made DNR/DNI and the plan is that she will be transferred to WIH and extubated there upon arrival with initiation of full palliative care .
The family understood this; all questions were answered and they wished to proceed .
They understand that there is no ICU at WIH and no further advanced pulmonary support can be offered .

History of Present Illness :
Patient is a 77 year old female with a past medical history significant for GI bleeding secondary to arteriovenous malformations , who presents with maroon stool and a hematocrit drop .
Three days ago began to develop black stools .
There was no clear blood in the toilet bowl .
In addition , she developed nausea and decreased PO intake .
She had a cough productive of white sputum and felt warm , although she did not record her temperature .
At dialysis on day of admission , she related these symptoms for the first time and had a bloody bowel movement .
Concerned , the staff sent her directly to the Nantucket Cottage Hospital .
In the Deanna , her temperature was 96.5 , HR 51 , BP 112/60 , RR 18 , and oxygen saturation was 98% on ambient air .
Her hematocrit was measured at 23.5 , while her baseline hematocrit is in the low 30 s.
An NG lavage was performed and there was bilious return .
Rectal examination was notable for guiaiac positive maroon stool .
She was type and crossed and transfused two units of packed red blood cells .
IV PPI was given and the GI team was consulted and she was scheduled for colonoscopy and EGD on the morning of 6/8 .
She was transferred to the CMED CCU for observation .
Brief Hospital Course :
Blood loss anemia from GI bleeding - the bleeding was likely from an AVM .
EGD , colonoscopy and tagged scan results as above .
eventhough uptake was noted in the rt LQ , no clear site of bleeding was noticed on colonoscopy .
hence , no intervention was performed .
she was transfused with 5 units of PRBC in the ICU andsent to the Lahey Clinic - North Shore .
Her hematocrit remained stable for 4 days prior to discharge .
No further bleeding noted .
GI consult team followed pt in hospital .
On discussion with Dr Leigh and Dr White from GI - they recommended that she follow with Dr. Taylor for consideration of argon photocoagulation as out-patient .
Given the innumerable number of AVM 's , it is diffcult to assess which the culprit lesion is and GI may start APL from the fundus of stomach .
Patient to get CBC checked with PCP this week as below .
ASA was held and may be restarted if Hct stable in clinic at the PCP 's discretion .
Chronic thrombocytopenia was noted , however the patient did not require platelet transfusions .
Has a h/o HIT .
The metoprolol was held during acute bleeding phase and restarted prior to discharge as her BP stabilized .
Other medical problems stable .
Dialysis was continued 3 / week .
I personally talked with Dr Pannell at the time of discharge to update him with the hospital events ."

FICU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 71-year-old-female with asthma and a history of recent exacerbation of lower extremity edema who , at her baseline , gets short of breath walking across the room and sleeps on four pillows times several years .
She has reported that she has had upper respiratory symptoms times several days with increasing dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath , eventually at rest with marked wheezing .
She also has a cough with a small amount of white sputum .
At 3 a.m. on the day of admission , she became much worse and after several days of increasing her meter-dosed inhaler use , she call Emergency Medical Services which assessed her as having heart failure with elevated jugular venous distention and rales .
She received aspirin , Lasix 40 mg intravenously times two , 0.8 mg of nitroglycerin times four , plus morphine sulfate .
Her blood pressure was noted to be up to 220/110 .
She was taken to the The Hospital for Orthopedics Emergency Room where she was assessed as having asthma .
She then received continuous nebulizer treatments for approximately eight hours with minimal improvement .
She did receive intravenous nitroglycerin in the Emergency Room for blood pressure controlled to the 170s .
She initially received a treatment of BiPAP on arrival as she was barely able to speak .
She also received 80 mg of Solu-Medrol in the Emergency Department .
She was never hypoxic but initially her arterial blood gas showed a respiratory acidosis with a PCO2 of 71 .
The patient does have a vague history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , but this is felt to be inaccurate .
She also received captopril 12.5 mg times one .
Recently , the patient has been treated with several steroid tapers .
Depending on the family , patient , and the OMR records , the exact duration of the most recent one was unclear .
It either ended in 2011-04-11 or continued through 2011-05-11 with use of Augmentin ; and , by report , lasted until 06-07 .
However , the family said the patient has been on steroids for several weeks .
The patient denies any exposure to smoke , animals , unusual dust or vapors , or other asthma triggers .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. PULMONARY :
She was treated with albuterol and Atrovent continuous nebulizers and was weaned then to intermittent nebulizer treatments and then to her meter-dosed inhalers taking them q.4h. at the time of discharge .
She was continued on salmeterol and Flovent .
She was continued on Solu-Medrol 80 mg q.8h. then converted to prednisone at 60 mg p.o. q.d.
She was started on Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.d.
Serial arterial blood gases were followed after an arterial line was placed .
Her PCO2 gradually declined to the 48 range .
Despite episodes of somnolence the first night which were presumably due to having spent the entire night in the Emergency Department , she never became more hypercarbic , and her PCO2 trended to 48 by the time the arterial line was discontinued .
On the night of admission and thereafter , she was noted to have a very stridorous sounding breathing when the patient was asleep .
This would disappear whenever she was awake .
Her case was discussed with Ear/Nose/Throat and the Medical Intensive Care Unit attending .
She was given a trial of 80/20 mixed helium/oxygen to decrease the stridor but had minimal effect .
Ear/Nose/Throat recommended not considering this an airway problem unless she was stridorous while awake .
The patient was to arrange for Pulmonary and Medicine followup through her primary care physician upon discharge as she has not been seen in the Pulmonary Clinic in two years .
2. CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial creatine kinases , although these did rise to 816 .
MB was negative .
She was treated with captopril for hypertension , and this was switched to Norvasc 7.5 mg p.o. q.d. on discharge .
She had an echocardiogram which showed a hyperdynamic left ventricular of normal thickness and size , and no significant valvular disease .
She apparently did not have a cardiovascular component to her wheezing or shortness of breath ; however , she was to go home on Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. to help with lower extremity edema , as she experiences discomfort with this , and the team felt this may be a limiting factor with her prednisone compliance .
3. ENDOCRINE :
She was treated with a sliding-scale of regular insulin while she was in house .
She was given 500 mg p.o. q.d. of metformin to treat her steroid-induced diabetes on discharge .
This should be followed up by her primary care physician .
4. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
She was treated briefly with levofloxacin because of the gram-positive cocci in her sputum culture ; however , her symptoms were felt to be consistent with a viral upper respiratory infection , and levofloxacin was continued at the time of discharge .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Combivent meter-dosed inhaler 2 puffs q.4h. weaning to albuterol meter-dosed inhaler 2 puffs q.4h.
3. Salmeterol 2 puffs q.12h.
4. Flovent 220 mcg 2 puffs q.12h.
5. Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q.d. with taper .
6. Fentress 60 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7. Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Univasc 7.5 mg p.o. q.d.
9. Metformin 500 mg p.o. q.d.
Dyazide was discontinued ."

History of Present Illness :
82 F with h/o COPD , CAD , pafib and SSS s/p pacer on 05-08 for symptomatic pauses is transferred for large pericardial effusion ? needing drainage and CHF .
She was admitted to Cambridge Hospital 2018-05-24 with ARF ( Cr 3.5 up from 0.9 ) and SOB .
According to her guardian she was discharged to her NH for a few days after her pacer was placed 05-08 , which was complicated by a PTX requiring CT placement which had been d/c 'd in the hospital after resolution of her PTX .
She had some nausea / vomiting and generally was taking poor pos at her NH .
There had been some concern her nausea was due to her amiodarone which had been discontinued about 1 week ago .
She was then sent to Franklin Medical Center 05-24 with lethargy and n/v .
At Erich Lindemann Mental Health Center she was discovered to have ARF , a large pericardial effusion , and bilateral pleural effusions .
She was treated with IVF for her ARF .
She underwent a TTE at Erich Lindemann Mental Health Center today ( 05-26 ) showing mod-lg circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of RV diastolic collapse and no MV inflow evidence of tamponade , pacer wire located in RV apex .
There was still concern for her effusion contributing to her SOB at the OSH so she was transferred for drainage and treatment of CHF .
Today she only complains of some SOB , which she says remains largely unchanged over the past few days .
She denies any CP / cough / fever / abd pain / diarrhea / black or bloody stools / headache .
Brief Hospital Course :
A/P :
82 y/o f w h/o afib , SSS s/p pacer 05-08 c/b PTX requiring CT , CAD , who was readmitted 05-24 with ARF and lethargy , found to have a large pericardial effusion and bilateral pleural effusions , with echo showing no evidence of tamponade , who is transferred for possible pericardial effusion drainage and treatment of CHF , as well as drainage of bilateral pleural effusions .
She had a BNP of > 5000 on admission .
Since admission , she ruled out for MI by enzymes , and had a right sided thoracentesis which yielded transudative fluid .
WBC s since admission were as high as 14,000 but normalized .
She also had 2 echocardiograms which revealed persistent pericardial effusions .
She has been gently diuresed but has worsening ARF .
Her O2 requirement has increased despite diuresis .
She denies any CP / cough / fever , abdominal pain / diarrhea , black or bloody stools or headache .
Her urine output decreased to nearly zero .
In the setting of her ongoing pericardial effusion , she was transferred for closer observation to the CCU .
The CCU fellow and team declined to do pericardial drainage , as the pt was hemodynamically stable , without change in appearance of effusion by echo performed at bedside by cards fellow .
As she was felt by the CCU to be a poor candidate for right heart cath , was hemodynamically stable with blood pressure 110 s- 120 s systolic and pulse 70 s- 80 s , she was called out of the CCU and back to the cardiac floor without intervention .
The procedure team was called to consider doing a left thoracentesis , but she was declined because it was felt that her effusions were transudative , secondary to CHF , and it was recommended to treat CHF .
The pt continued to have low urine output .
She was given a lasix drip IV upon call-out of the ICU , and additional boluses of IV lasix , 200 mg then 300 mg IV were given with a good response , however , she remained net positive fluid balance .
Renal consultants did not feel there was an emergent need for dialysis .
A nitro drip was started in an effort to decrease her preload and afterload .
On call out from the CCU , the pt was satting 93% on 4-5L NC , and through the following night , her oxygen requirement increased to NRB , wherein she was satting upper 80 s- low 90 s.
ABG that evening was 7.29/51/56 on 4L NC and early the next morning , was 7.25/62/64 on NRB .
A CXR was performed the evening of 5/16 , showing moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions , stable cardiomegaly and a possible RLL infiltrate .
Vancomycin and Zosyn were started .
She was afebrile .
The morning of 5/17 , her pulsus parodoxicus was 12 .
Because of her ABG , and declining clinical status , the CCU was notified for possible transfer .
The CMED CSRU Intern called the Murphy , Robert Leigh , to give her the update with regards to the pt 's deteriorating clinical status .
It was felt that given her age , multiple co-morbidities , that her prognosis was poor even prior to CCU admission , possible pericardial drainage or repeat thoracenteses .
Goals of care were clarified with her Murphy , Robert Sanchez .
Explained to Lewin that pt will likely need to be intubated , as she cannot lie flat , and most likely cannot undergo pericardial drainage , thoracentesis , or right heart cath with BiPAP ( which would have been the next measure after NRB , and prior to intubation ).
Explained that despite these invasive measures , she still has a very poor prognosis .
Odell stated she had been thinking about this all night of 2018-05-30 , and agreed that this is not what the pt would have wanted .
Odell does not believe the pt would want to be intubated , with central line , right heart cath , in the CCU .
She requested the patient be made Comfort Measures Only .
She was DNR/DNI on admission .
This was documented in the computer , confirmed with Cardiology attending and fellow , and conveyed to the CCU staff , who were informed she may need to go for transfer ( which was subsequently cancelled ).
The pt will be made comfortable , with goals of care shifted towards suppressing her air hunger and pain .
#. SOB : Most consistent with CHF by exam , although unknown what the severity of her COPD is currently .
TTE revealed large pericardial effusion .
Pt is now s/p drainage of right pleural effusion , diagnostic and therapeutic , with studies consistent with transudate , etiology most likely 02-15 CHF .
We continued her albuterol / atrovent nebs , diuresis with IV lasix drip and boluses .
Her 05-27 CXR post procedure w/o PNX , effusion much improved , yet her 05-28 CXR worse than 05-27 with some reaccumulation of right pleural effusion .
Then , on 05-29 , she demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions ( reaccumulated ), right lower lobe infiltrate ( started on vanco / zosyn )-> put on face mask , given lasix x 1 bolus 100 mg , responded somewhat and o2 sat stable in low 90 s.
She was given 200 mg IV lasix X 1 with an additional 100 cc of urine output the evening of 5/16 .
Her lasix gtt continued during this time .
Her oxygen sats did not improve .
She was then made CMO .
See above .
#. Pericardial effusion : unclear etiology , OSH had raised question of RV perforation from pacer , however she had a normal echo appearance of lead , no tamponade by exam .
This has still be known to occur during the placement of pacemaker .
It was felt posthumously that her large pericardial effusion was most likely secondary to a complication of pacer placement , although this was not seen on imaging .
In the last 12 hours of her life , her pulsus was 12 , and she was felt to likely to have aspect of tamponade physiology , since her preload was reduced .
#. CHF : normal EF on TTE so possibly with diastolic dysfunction , ruled out for MI
- See course of diuresis above .
- We continued ASA / imdur / CCB / hold diovan until pt was made CMO .
#. Pleural effusions : Likely due to CHF although had some leukocytosis at admission to OSH .
Mary studies c/w transudate .
- After she was made CMO , the pt was started on Morphine gtt to maximize comfort and minimize air hunger .
#. Afib/SSS : She was A-paced , pacer placed 05-08 in DDDR mode , complicated by PTX requiring chest tube which resolved and tube was removed during admit for pacer , no evidence of PTX on most recent CXR .
Her pacer wires in correct position .
We continued amiodarone until pt was made CMO .
Anticoagulation has not been given this admission .
She was a poor anticoagulation candidate .
We started her on dilt for additional a fib control ( revert back to a fib on 05-29 ), which was stopped when the pt was made CMO .
#. Oliguric ARF : likely prerenal due to n/v poor po intake and poor forward flow , However , need to continue diuresis .
Her urine lytes consistent with ATN , FENA 4% .
Renal u/s negative for hydronephrosis .
Renal consultants did not feel that there was an indication for urgent hemodialysis .
She continued to put out low amounts of urine throughout the admission , despite aggressive diuresis with IV lasix gtt and boluses .
See above .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a seventy-one year old white female with stenotic area on her mid sigmoid , noticed on barium enema .
The ultrasound showed ascites and question of pelvic mass .
The patient was explored by General surgery , who saw the 3C ovarian carcinoma .
The patient also had an omentectomy and ileostomy .
The patient was admitted for one cycle of Cytoxan and Cisplatin , and subsequently underwent debulking in June 1992 , as well as a total abdominal hysterectomy/ bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , omentectomy , splenectomy , rectosigmoid resection with a take down of the ileostomy .
Also ileal cecal resection , MDR showed that Cisplatin and VP 16 were more effective .
The patient now presents for line 1 , cycle 4 to 15 of VP 16 and Cisplatin chemotherapy .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital and received two units of packed red blood cells for her hematocrit of 26 , and had a magnesium repleted .
The patient received three days of chemotherapy , consisting of 45 mg. of Cisplatin 160 mg. of VP 16 , and tolerated chemotherapy resonably well .
Serial PTs were obtained , and the patient was noted to have an initial PT of 10.9 on admission , despite Coumadin at home .
She was given 10 mg. on hospital day # 1 , and 5 mg. on hospital day 2 , and back to 2.5 qhs .
The patient &apos;s pro time bumped to 19.5 on hospital day # 3 , and the patient was instructed to continue with 2 1/2 mg. qhs and is to followup with Anticoagulation Clinic in one week for further pro time checks and adjustments .
The patient did develop some hypertension during infusion of her VP 16 to the 170/100 range , which apparently happened during her prior chemotherapy .
The patient was instructed to followup with her internist regarding further evaluation of her hypertension , and should be assessed regarding further management , as an inpatient , or while receiving chemotherapy ."

According to his wife , he came home and went to sleep .
When she tried to awaken him at 11 a.m. , she was unable to do so and called EMS .
She did not notice any blood / urine / emesis / stool in the bed .
EMS found him with agonal respirations and pinpoint pupils .
FS 420 .
He received 1 mg IV Narcan ( numerous bottles of oxycontin , percocet were found in room ); his pupils dilated to ~ 8 mm and he became combative / agitated .
He was then intubated for airway protection ( etomidate / succinate ); it was a traumatic intubation 
and one of his teeth was chipped .
He was transported to Hallmark Health System Monica , where ABG 7.14/82/44 while bagging on 100% FiO2 .
Wife reports that he drank a large amt of alcohol ( 12 bottles of beer ) night PTA .
For 2 days PTA , he has expressed a wish to kill himself ( no clear plan , but fixing things around the house "" so things will be ready when I 'm gone "").
In Monica , pt received charcoal , 500 mg IV levofloxacin , 500 mg IV metronidazole for presumed aspiration pna .
Brief Hospital Course :
A : 39 year old male w/ HTN , chronic LBP on narcotics presents after being found unresponsive at home .
P :
1) Unresponsiveness : This is likely due todrug overdose ( known oxycontin use , (+) BNZ on tox screen ).
Ddx : cardiac ischemia ( no ischemic EKG changes noted ), seizure w/ post-ictal state , CVA ( head CT neg ).
His cardiac enzymes include only elevated CK , but not Shaffer , Juan he ruled out for MI .
His mental status gradually improved from 03-23 to 03-24 .
He was able to communicate appropriately as his level of narcotic medications waned in his blood .
He was able to maintain a stable mental level for extubation on 03-24 .
As of 3/21 , he was alert , appropriate and answers questions and follows command on exam .
2) Pulmonary infiltrates : THere was initially concern that he was developing ARDS from aspiration pneumonia in the setting of being found unconscious .
He was intubated and was on mechanical ventilation from 9/13 10/11 , but he was started on levofloxacin 
and flagyl for total of 4 days .
ON 03-26 , his antibiotics were started as this most likely represent a transiet aspiration episode and not ARDS .
3) Airway protection : He was intubated in the field for airway protection
He was extubated on 03-24 and was weaned off oxygen slowly from 03-24 to 03-26 without significant event .
4) Hypertension : He was restarted on his atenolol and verapamil once his blood pressure stabilized on 03-25 .
5) Depression : He was restarted on his paxil on 03-25 and was given 1:1 sitter for suicidal ideation leading up to his suicide leading up to this admission .
He has not had further episodes while he was in the hospital .
- plan to restart Paxil when taking PO
6) Hyperglycemia : Although he has no known history of_ diabetes , his elevated FS noted in field with glycosuria prompted fingerstick check but he has not required insulin coverage .
7) High amylase : He was admitted on 03-23 with elevated amylase but non-elevated lipase .
This likely is not concerning of pancreatic process .
His amylase trended down .
He was restarted on regular diet on 4/14 4/17 after his extubation

Patient initially p/w c/o sudden onset N/abd pain/chills w/ T 103 at NH .
Rigors progressed so she was brought to Robert .
She reported h/o fatigue and anorexia for the past few days and had noticed foul smelling urine and some abdominal distension , similar to prior episodes of pyelo .
She also c/o LLQ and groin pain which responded to tylenol .
She denies V or D .
No AMS .
No c/o CP .
On arrival to Shirley , temperature was 101.2 .
CT abd showed an 8 mm right proximal ureteral stone with right-sided hydronephrosis and inflammatory stranding , in addition to pyelonephritis of the left kidney without left sided hydronephrosis .
Labs were remarkable for wbc 23.5 w/ 1% bands which decreased to 14 today but now w/ 15% bands on vanc ( h/o MRSA urosepsis ) and gent ( mult drug allergies ) .
AG on admission 18 ( bicarb 17 , down from 23 on a previous admission ) , down to AG 15 this AM .
ABG prior to transfer ( on room air ) :
7.43/24/69 w/ lactate 1.3 ( down from 1.4 on the prior day ) .
Currently , 03-14 blood cx are growing GNR in both anaerobic bottles .
Urine cx is pending .
Prior to transfer , patient dropped bp to 68/40s .
BP did not improve despite 2 L NS and 100 mg IV hydrocortisone .
A central line was placed and she was sent to IR for a right nephrostomy tube .
Brief Hospital Course :
47 yo F w/ h/o steroid-induced hyperglycemia , SLE w/ h/o pericarditis , transverse myelitis w/ paraplegia and neurogenic bladder s/p urostomy w/ ileal conduit , h/o ureteropelvic stone and urosepsis , and h/o RLE DVT admitted 11-29 w/ left pyelo and right 8 mm proximal ureteral stone w/ right hydro s/p perc urostomy tube to relieve right hydro .
.
## GNR sepsis:
Upon admission , pt was febrile to 101.2 with U/A consistent with UTI .
A CT abd showed 8mm obstructing stone , hydro with stranding consistent with pylonephritis .
Her presentation was thought likely due to urosepsis given h/o foul smelling urine and in setting of stone w/ hydro + pyelo by CT. The patient went to IR on 2014-11-30 given evidence of right hydronephrosis on imaging for decompression and drainage. Upon admission , she was treated with Vancomycin and Gentamycin and Flagyl .
She was started on the MUST protocol with high dose steroids as well and a goal SVO2 >70% .
She was hypoxic requiring 3L nasal cannula O2 .
She subsequently developed hypotension with SBP in the 70s .
She was transferred to the CMED where the patient was continued on the MUST protocol with goais of CVP 10-12 , SVO2 greater than 70% .
The patient was bolused with NS and did not required pressors .
On the day after admission to the CMED , the patient was noted to have small oxygen requirement with 2L NC .
Repeat imaging revealed evidence of mild pulmonary congestion which was thought to account for the patient 's mild hypoxia .
Given that the patient had been maintaining a MAP of 60 without fluids or pressors , her goal CVP was decreased to >8 to avoid fluid overload .
The patient was continued on Vancomycin and Gentamycin while speciation and sensitivities were pending .
Ciprofloxacin was added on 2014-12-01 for synergy when surveillance cultures were found to be growing again GNR .
Gent and Cipro were then discontinued and changed to meropenem when blood culture sensitivities became available revealing GNR sensitive to Jacoby but resistant to both Gent and Cipro .
Additionaly surveillance cultures were drawn daily and the patient was transferred back to the floor with no subsequent pressor requirement .
Blood cltures from 11-30 grew KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE and 12-01 grew KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE and PROTEUS MIRABILIS both sensitive to the Meropenam which she had already been receiving .
Urine cultures from 11-30 grew STAPH AUREUS COAG + , and GRAM NEGATIVE RODS of two morphologies ( not further speciated ) .
She defervesed by 12-02 and remained clinically stable with normal blood pressures until the day of discharge .
At the time of discharge , blood cultures from 12-02 and 12-03 have no growth to date .
She received a midline on 12-04 with a goal of 16 days of further antibiotic treatment with Meropenam ( for a total of 3 weeks ) upon discharge back to the nursing home where she lives .
.
## Right hydronephrosis :
Given right sided hydronephrosis and GNR bactermeia , a percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed by IR 2014-11-30 .
The patient put out 1385 cc urine the day after placement , 950 cc of which came from nephrostomy tube .
The tube appeared to be functioning well , draining urine with occasional clot passage .
Urology was notified about the clots and occasional blood tinged urine but they did not make any further recommendations .
Cultures from urine drawn from the nephrostomy tube are currently growing > 100K GNR , possibly of two colony morphologies , speciation and sensitivity pending .
.
## Hct drop :
On admission to hospital patient had Hct of 29.2 .
In the setting of Right sublavian line placement as well as nephrostomy tube placement the patient was noted to have a drifting Hct , concerning for bleed , with nadir of 22.8 on 2014-12-01 .
A CT abdomen was performed which did not demonstrate any retroperitoneal bleed .
Hct stabilized to 24 for three days prior to discharge .
This can be followed as an outpatient .
Anemia workup revealed a picture of anemia of chronic disease ( TIBC 225 , B12 and Folate normal , Hapto 397 , Ferritin 51 , TRF 173 , Iron 35 ) .
.
## Hypoxia:
The patient on admission was requiring 3 L NC in the setting of receiving 2L NS and chest film which demonstrated pulmonary congestion .
The patient was not diuresed but allowed to auto-diurese any additional fluids and is currently with O2 sats 97-98% on room air .
As her BP remained stable she did not receiving any standing fluids but was be bolused as appropriate for a MAP < 60 or CVP < 8 with careful monitoring of pulmonary status .
Patient had an echocardiogram in 2012 which demonstrated an EF of 60-65% .
her O2 requirement by discharge was 96% on room air with no SOB .
.
## Steroid-induced hyperglycemia :
At home , the patient received metformin and SSI .
The patient 's metformin was held and she has been maintained on SSI qid while in the CMED .
As the patient appeared to be clinically stable , her stress dose steroids were discontinued and the patient was changed back to her home dose of Prednisone 40mg PO qd for maintenance with anticipated decrease in her blood sugars .
Her Metformin was re-added 2 days prior to discharge as well and fingerstick glucoses on the day of discharge were 93 and 156 , respectively .
.
## Hypothyroidism :
Repeat TSH and Free T4 were appropriate on current outpatient regimen. Patient was continued on Levothyroxine 75mcg po qd .
.
## H/o transverse myelitis/optic neuritis :
On stress dose steroids originally given MUST protocol and sepsis , as patient clinically stabilized , she was changed back to home dose of Prednisone 40mg pO qd .

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 57 - year-old female with a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia but no prior coronary artery disease history who presented with chest pain .
The patient reports the pain began at 4:00 p.m. on the day of admission .
She reports that it had essentially started earlier in the day with some GERD-like symptoms .
She had taken Maalox but had no relief with this .
The pain was intermittent through the day and then at 4:00 p.m. increased and was also associated with nausea and diaphoresis .
She reports that the pain shot through her back .
The patient has never had these symptoms in the past .
She arrived in the Emergency Room at 8:00 p.m.
At that time , the pain was unremitting .
In the Emergency Room , the patient was given Lopressor , nitroglycerin , and aspirin .
A TP3A inhibitor was not given for concern for dissection .
The patient was found to have 5057 E. Sixth Blvd. elevations in I , aVL , and V1 through V2 and ST depressions in II , III , and aVF .
The patient was taken emergently to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE : The patient was taken to Cardiac Catheterization where she was found to have two vessel disease .
The proximal LAD was found to have a 90% lesion with a septal branch with a 95% stenosis and a diagonal branch with 99% stenosis .
The patient had twin LAD stents to the LAD diagonal and LAD septal branches with Taxus stents .
This restored flow appropriately .
The patient also had proximal RCA lesion of 80% and a mid RCA lesion of 80-90% which were not intervened upon .
The patient was given an aspirin and Plavix and in addition started on a beta Elmore , Maxine ACE inhibitor , and these were titrated up as her blood pressure tolerated .
Given the fact that the patient had issues with muscle cramping with Atorvastatin in the past , she was started on Pravastatin which should give less of these side effects .
The patient will follow-up with Cardiology in one months time for further management of her coronary artery disease and further evaluation of her remaining RCA lesions .
2. PUMP : The patient had an echocardiogram to assess her LV function .
She was found to have an ejection fraction of 30-35% as well as an akinetic apex and apical mid and septal akinesis .
Given the fact that the patient had significant apical akinesis , she was started on heparin with a transition to Coumadin for anticoagulation for stroke prevention in the setting of apical akinesis .
On discharge , the patient was given Lovenox injections which should be continued until the patient reaches a therapeutic dose of Coumadin .
3. RHYTHM : The patient was monitored on telemetry throughout her hospitalization with no significant events .
The patient had an EP evaluation and will be followed-up by Dr. Welch .
14-087 , the patient had a signal-averaged EKG .
She will follow-up with Dr. Welch with an echocardiogram on 2015-07-24 in a meeting to discuss risk stratification for sudden cardiac death and possible ICD placement .
4. NEUROLOGY : The patient complained of left lower extremity weakness with ambulation two days after her cardiac catheterization .
The patient had no evidence for weakness on examination with good proximal and distal strength in the lower extremities as well as intact sensation .
The patient worked with Physical Therapy and was able to ambulate without difficulty .
She was also able to ascend stairs without difficulty .
The patient was already on an aspirin and Plavix should this represent a small stroke .
However , there was no evidence for neurologic deficit on examination and this will be followed-up by her primary care physician .
5. HEMATOLOGY : The patient was discharged on Coumadin for apical akinesis and stroke risk .
This will be further monitored by her primary care physician , Dr. Banks , who will adjust her Coumadin dose ."

Hepatitis B surface antigen negative , rubella immune .
Group B strep screening was negative .
Pregnancy was uncomplicated until an occurrence of HSV outbreak occurred on 2017-09-13 approximately one week prior to delivery .
Pregnancy was also complicated by maternal history of depression for which mother received Zoloft .
On day of delivery mother presented in spontaneous labor .
There were no sepsis risk factors .
GBS negative .
No maternal fever .
Rupture of membranes at time of delivery .
Delivery was by repeat cesarean section and Apgars of 8 and 9 were given at one and five minutes respectively .
Baby appeared well and went to the newborn nursery and was breast feeding and undergoing routine newborn care .
On the newborn nursery the mother called the nurse for concern of baby turning dusky while feeding .
She called the nurses and patted the infant on the back .
This episode was also accompanied by gagging motions noted of the infant .
A second episode occurred where the baby turned pale .
Mother thought the baby just did not look right .
The baby did not turn blue at that time .
The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit was notified and the baby was transferred to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS :
Respiratory :
The infant was placed on a cardiopulmonary monitor upon admission to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit with pulse oximetry .
He was noted to have an episode of desaturation related to feeding with desaturations in the 70 percent .
This resolved spontaneously when the bottle was pulled from the baby 's mouth .
Jule remained in room air without any evidence of respiratory distress and was without any further dusky spells or pale episodes in the 48 hours prior to discharge .
Cardiovascular :
Renee remained cardiovascularly stable with AP s noted to be 120 to 130 s.
Blood pressure 84/43 with a mean of 59 .
Fluid , electrolytes and nutritions :
The baby had been breast feeding ad lib in the Newborn Nursery .
He continued to feed ad lib while a patient in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit .
He was fed with a bottle occasionally by his dad and had a vigorous suck and was noted to have some discoordination of his suck while breathing at the initial onset of feeding time .
This resolved with removal of the bottle from the baby 's mouth .
Breast feeding was limited to four to five minutes on each side per recommendation of neurology after their evaluation to try and minimize incidence of gastroesophageal reflux .
Weight at time of discharge is 3.13 kilograms .
Birth weight was 3.29 kilograms in the 75th percentile .
Head circumference was 34.5 cm , 75th percentile , and length was 50.7 cm , also the 75th percentile .
Gastrointestinal :
Baby was noted to have frequent spitting episodes .
This was minimized with limitation of volume at each feed with frequent feeding .
He had normal voiding and stooling patterns .
The baby demonstrated mild physiologic jaundice with a serum bilirubin obtained on day of life three which was 6.7 with a direct of 0.2 .
Mother 's blood type is O negative .
Infant 's blood type was O positive and Coombs was noted to be negative .
Hematologic :
In addition a complete blood count was obtained on admission with a white count of 10.1 with 43 polys and 0 bands .
Hematocrit was noted to 47.5 with platelets of 257,000 .
There were no blood products received during hospitalization .
Infectious disease :
A blood culture was obtained upon admission and Ampicillin and Gentamicin were given for 48 hours with blood cultures remaining sterile .
Antibiotics were discontinued on day of life three and infant has remained clinically well off antibiotics .
Neurology :
Neurology was consulted due to the concern for seizures in the setting of dusky episodes .
Neurology evaluated the baby and found the baby to have a normal neurological examination .
An EEG was performed .
The EEG showed transient sharp waves in the left front , left occipital and right parietal regions .
There was no electrographic evidence of seizure activity noted .
Sensory :
Hearing screening was performed with automated auditory brain stem responses .
Baby passed in both ears on 09-23 .
Ophthalmology :
Ophthalmology was consulted due to the presence of a coloboma into the left CMED .
Ophthalmology noted that this left Martha coloboma was likely an isolated anomaly in the absence of other pathology .

Prenatal screens include blood type O negative .
Other prenatal screens were unknown at time of delivery .
Pregnancy was uncomplicated until the day of delivery when mother presented to HealthSouth New England Rehab Hospital Hospital with bleeding and was sent home .
She then presented to Jordan Hospital Hospital where she was noted to be 5 cm dilated with a transverse lie presentation .
She was given betamethasone times one and transferred to the Nantucket Cottage Hospital where she was delivered by cesarean section with rupture of membranes at time of delivery notable for slight meconium stained amniotic fluid .
The baby emerged with spontaneous cry , received routine care and then was intubated in the Delivery Room due to inconsistent respiratory effort and increased work of breathing .
Apgars were 6 at one minute and 8 at five minutes .
She was transferred to the newborn Intensive Care Unit for further management .

Maximum mechanical ventilation PIP 26 , PEEP 6 , rate of 25 , maximum FIO2 35 percent .
Mychelia was extubated to a CPAP of 6 cm on day of life two where she remained until day of life 20 .
On day of life two , she was also loaded with caffeine and continues on caffeine at time of transfer .
She was transitioned to a nasal cannula on day of life 20 and remains on nasal cannula O2 100 percent at 13 cc flow .
She averaged 2-3 apnea episodes a day with bradycardia and desaturations .
She has a comfortable respiratory rate and good air exchange .
Cardiovascular :
She received a normal saline bolus times one initially for poor perfusion and was started on dopamine with a maximum infusion rate of 6 mcg per kg per hour .
This was discontinued on day of life two to maintain a mean arterial pressure of greater than 33 .
She has remained hemodynamically stable during the remainder of her hospitalization here .
Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition :
Initially maintained NPO .
UAC and UVC lines were placed upon admission to the CMED .
The UAC was left in place until day of life two and was removed after wean from dopamine .
UVC remained in place through day of life six and was utilized to administer parenteral nutrition .
Electrolytes and glucose remained in the normal range throughout the first week .
She was started on enteral feeds on day of life six with a slow advance secondary to increased abdominal girth which was felt to be due to CPAP .
She passed meconium .
She achieved full feeds on day of life 13 .
Calories were gradually increased to breast milk 30 calories with ProMod consisting of four of human milk fortifier , four of MCT and two of Polycose with a 12-28 teaspoon of ProMod per 50 ml of breast milk or 60 ml of formula .
On day of life six due to concerns for hyperglycemia and abdominal distention , sepsis evaluation was obtained .
She was noted at this time to have hyperglycemia requiring two subcutaneous doses of insulin and a decreased glucose infusion rate to achieve euglycemia .
This resolved that same day .
Urine output was always noted to be of sufficient quantity .
Gastrointestinal :
Mychelia demonstrated slow gastrointestinal motility and abdominal distention felt to be due to CPAP .
She was slow to advance on enteral feeds and gradually attained full enteral volume on day of life 13 .
On day of life 15 , she was made NPO for a distended abdomen and a bilious spit .
Serial KUBs revealed nonspecific changes with dilated loops .
No pneumatosis or free air was seen .
She was noted to have bluish discoloration thought to perhaps be a bruise on her left lower quadrant .
There was no radiographic correlation with this .
Feeds were restarted .
Again , she was advanced to full volume but was made NPO on day of life 20 for abdominal distention .
This NPO was temporary for that day and she then resumed feedings and has been tolerating full enteral feeds well , improved since off of CPAP , passing normal stools , guaiac negative .
Mychelia was also treated for physiologic jaundice .
She was started under phototherapy on day of life one through day of life three with a peak serum bilirubin of 4.7/0.3 .
This issue resolved .
Hematologic and Infectious Disease :
Initial CBC was notable for a white count of 5.5 with 49 polys , 1 band and 47 lymphs .
Initial hematocrit was 46.3 percent and platelets 320,000 .
Her initial blood culture remained negative and she received 48 hours of ampicillin and gentamicin .
As previously noted on day of life six with hyperglycemia , abdominal distention , a CBC and blood culture were again obtained revealing a white count of 9.1 with 30 polys , 0 bands and 58 lymphs .
Hematocrit at that time was noted to be 31 and platelets 370,000 .
Blood culture grew staph coagulase negative and the baby received seven days of vancomycin and gentamicin .
A lumbar puncture was also performed to rule out meningitis .
This culture remained negative with normal cell counts and chemistries .
Antibiotic levels were monitored and doses adjusted accordingly .
Mychelia required two transfusions during her hospital stay .
On day of life 15 for a hematocrit of 29 , she received 20 cc of packed red blood cells .
She started on iron and vitamin E supplements on day of life 25 and continues on that at this time of transfer .
However , on day of life 34 , 12-04 , she was noted to be pale and less stress tolerant , mottling easily with care .
A hematocrit and reticulocyte count showed a hematocrit of 23 percent and a reticulocyte count of 1.9 percent .
Therefore , with blood available from the first aliquot , a second 20 cc per kg of packed red blood cells were infused without incident .
Neurological :
Initial head ultrasound on day of life seven was normal .
At one month of age , on 12-03 , she was noted to have an absent septum pellucidum .
An MRI obtained and reviewed by the Hallmark Health System Radiology Department revealed focal gyral morphology consistent with prematurity , normal midline structures , normal myelination , no lesions , no signal abnormalities or extracerebral collections .
The cortical ribbon is intact .
The major vascular structures at the skull base are normal .
The septal leaflets may be partially absent , but there are no coronal images provided for confirmation and the pituitary stalk is present .

History of Present Illness :
This is a 32 year old male who was recently discharged from Mediplex Rehab Hospital and presents again to us with chief complaint of abdominal pain ( sudden onset left-sided abdominal pain ).
Of note , he had a recent kidney biopsy on 2018-07-30 and his Cr bumped from 4.7 to 5.7 .
Also , HCT on admission 21 from 25 .
Brief Hospital Course :
This patient was admitted on 08-04 after a recent discharge from the hospital for sudden onset of left sided abdominal pain .
In the emergency room , his ultrasound showed mild hydronephrosis with new perinephric fluid surrounding the transplant kidney and hence , underwent a CT scan of his abdomen / pelvis which showed a large left-sided of retroperitoneal hemorrhage extending down to the level of the renal transplant possibly related to recent transplant biopsy .
Renal transplant medicine and transplant surgery were made aware and the pt was admitted to transplant
CMED and to the ICU .
Serial hematocrits and abdominal exams were performed .
He was not taken to the OR .
On 08-06 , he received 2 units of pRBC and underwent plasmaphersis , followed by 10mg of IVIG .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 82 - year-old male with a history of hypertension , remote tobacco abuse , chronic renal insufficiency , and a history of a TIA who was in his usual state of health until five nights prior to admission when he awoke at midnight with severe epigastric pain radiating to both arms .
He also had bilateral arm numbness .
The symptoms were associated with diaphoresis and shortness of breath but no nausea or vomiting .
After approximately one hour , he presented to the Bristol County Tuberculosis Hospital Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Campus where he ruled in for a non-ST elevation MI with a CK of 438 with a peak CK MB of 19.8 and troponin that peaked at 10.2 .
He was started on nitrates there as well as heparin and Integrelin and remained pain-free .
He denied any history of similar symptoms in the past and has had no prior history of angina or myocardial infarction .
The patient was subsequently transferred to Youville Hospital for cardiac catheterization .
At the time of transfer , he was initially admitted to the CMI Service after undergoing cardiac catheterization which revealed a long LAD lesion that was angioplastied without stent placement , and a total occlusion of the RCA with collaterals .
He subsequently became hypotensive and bradycardiac in the Catheterization Laboratory which responded to IV fluids , dopamine , Atropine , and he was then transferred to the CCU for further monitoring .
He had a bedside transthoracic echocardiogram done in the Cardiac Catheterization laboratory without evidence of an effusion .
A Swan was also placed .
There were no stents deployed at all throughout the catheterization .
By the time he was admitted , he was off pressors and hemodynamically stable and pain-free .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. CARDIOVASCULAR :
As summarized above , the patient had a non-ST elevation MI with evidence of an 80 percent mid LAD lesion for which he underwent angioplasty without stent placement .
He was initially continued on aspirin , Plavix , beta blocker , statin , and ACE inhibitor .
At the time of discharge , his Plavix was held due to Guaiac positive stools and hematocrit drop throughout admission .
He had a transthoracic echocardiogram the day after admission showing an ejection fraction of greater than 60 percent .
No focal wall motion abnormalities .
He had no recurrent chest pain or shortness of breath throughout admission .
In regards to his rhythm , he has an underlying right bundle branch block and first-degree AV block which were stable throughout this admission .
He will be followed-up by his cardiologist after discharge .
1. PULMONARY :
He had a history of COPD for which he is on baseline 2 liters of 02 by nasal cannula at home and Albuterol and Atrovent MDI s p.r.n. at home .
He is also on Flovent MDI at home as well .
He was continued on his MDI and was at his baseline 02 requirement throughout admission .
1. RENAL :
He has a history of chronic renal insufficiency likely secondary to hypertension and was admitted with a creatinine of 1.6 .
His ACE inhibitor post MI was initially held due to his creatinine .
However , this responded to IV fluids and his ACE inhibitor was restarted at the time of discharge .
He will need close monitoring of his creatinine post discharge in the setting of reinstitution of his ACE inhibitor .
1. GASTROINTESTINAL :
His stools were noted to be Guaiac positive at the outside hospital and there was still concern for possible GI bleed given continued Guaiac positive stools during this admission and a slight drop in his hematocrit from 39 to 33 .
It was felt most appropriate for him to have an outpatient GI workup , and his PCP was contacted and will arrange for outpatient colonoscopy .
His Plavix was held at the time of discharge due to a question of GI bleed and in the setting of not having a stent placed at the time of catheterization .
He was continued on his aspirin , however ."

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65-year-old man with refractory CLL , status post non-myeloblative stem cell transplant approximately nine months prior to admission , and status post prolonged recent Retelk County Medical Center stay for Acanthamoeba infection of skin and sinuses , complicated by ARS due to medication toxicity , as well as GVHD and recent CMV infection , readmitted for new fever , increasing creatinine , hepatomegaly and fluid surge spacing , in the setting of hyponatremia .
Patient initially presented in 1991 with cervical lymphadenopathy , was treated with MACE / CytaBOM , and did well until 1997 , when he received six cycles of fludarabine for progressive disease .
In November , 2001 , he progressed to leukemic phase , received Rituxan and CVP .
Started Campath in July , 2001 , complicated by lymphopenia / neutropenia and CMV infection , and underwent MUD stem cell transplant in December , 2002 .
The patient had bone marrow biopsy , August , 2003 , for persistent pancytopenia , revealing mild hypercelluarity with 80% leukemic cells .
He was again treated with Campath , had recurrent fever in association with sinus symptoms , with CT scan showing left maxillary sinusitis in association with new skin nodules on right elbow and buttocks .
Patient was hospitalized September 26 to November 11 for what was diagnosed by skin biopsy and sinus washings as Acanthamoeba infection of skin and sinuses , without any progression to neurologic infection ( as assessed by head CT and MRI ) .
ID consult was obtained and he was initially treated with azithromycin , itraconazole , and pentamidine , with progression of skin infection .
Subsequent discontinuance of azithromycin , trial of 5-FC , with increasing neutropenia requiring discontinuance , change if itraconazole to voriconazole , given continued neutropenia , and trial of sulfadiazine , discontinued for increasing ARS .
Patient was maintained on p.o. voriconazole and IV pentamidine , with pentamidine nasal washings , with re-CT of sinuses near end of stay showing no change in disease burden .
He has had recurrent CMB infection in the setting of Campath therapy , requiring IV Foscarnet therapy during stay , with inability to tolerate valganciclovir maintenance suppression subsequently due to increasing ARS .
Hypercapture near end of stay was negative .
Patient experienced acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency , with previous baseline creatinine 1.6 , felt to be due to medication toxicity , requiring Kayexalate and Phoslo to manage electrolytes , but never any need for hemodialysis , with mild improvement of creatinine by discharge , with peak creatinine 3.4 , discharge creatinine 2.6 .
Patient struggled with GVHD , with extensive skin involvement , taking Cellcept , prednisone and cyclosporine at time of last admission .
Cellcept was discontinued in the setting of infection , but attempts to decrease prednisone or cyclosporine were unsuccessful .
Patient returns from rehabilitation after discharge on November 11 , with new fever up to 102.0 in DSCI clinic , increasing hepatomegaly as assessed by examination in clinic , and increasing creatinine .
Patient reports no significant changes in how he feels over the past week .
Denies cough , shortness of breath , chest pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , dysuria , neck stiffness , new skin lesions , worsening red petechiae , or increasing sinus symptoms .
Patient reports persistent mild right upper quadrant discomfort , recent poor appetite .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient was admitted for diagnosis and treatment of new fever .
Workup on admission included a chest x-ray negative for pneumonia , an MRI of the liver to investigate for focal lesion , with no evidence for abscess or focal lesion on report .
Blood and urine cultures with only positive culture a blood culture on November 20 , with one of two bottles positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus .
A repeat CMV hypercapture , negative for presence of CMV .
A repeat CAT scan of the sinuses with finding of progressive thickening of the left maxillary sinus and both sets of ethmoid air cells since prior study of November 9 , indicating progressive infection of Acanthamoeba and any possible superinfection with bacterial sinusitis .
In the days following admission , there was clear evidence for progression of erythematous nodules over both arms and right thigh at foci of Acanthamoeba infection , suggesting progressive skin involvement with Acanthamoeba .
Infectious disease consult was obtained and recommendation was to switch from voriconazole to itraconazole , on which there was more existing data on treatment of Acanthamoeba infection .
Pentamidine intravenous and nasal washings were continued .
Clinical progression of skin and sinus infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy continued , with emergence on November 20 of a new right-sided ptosis in association with a left homonymous hemianopsia , and fleeting confusion while febrile , prompting head MRI which revealed a large 5 x 2 x 4.3 cm region in the right occipital lobe of hemorrhage and edema , with dural and , likely , leptomeningeal enhancement in association with small foci in the right cerebellum and pons , concerning for early lesions of similar type .
Idiosyncratic reaction to cyclosporine was considered as cause for cerebritis , and cyclosporine was discontinued .
However , much more likely explanation is progressive infection of Acanthamoeba with new neurologic involvement .
Most likely source of fevers was judged to be progressive Acanthamoeba infection , even on maximal antimicrobial therapy .
A single blood culture positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus was treated with a course of vancomycin in the setting of a PICC line and a chest x-ray on November 20 indicating possible developing pneumonia , resulted in a course of levofloxacin , for both possible pneumonia , as well as treatment of any bacterial superinfection of Acanthamoeba sinusitis .
Patient experienced steady decline , with persistent fevers despite all above measures , progressive areas of skin infection , more frequent episodes of confusion , and decreasing oxygen saturation in the setting of bilateral effusion , in the setting of fluid surge spacing .
On November 30 , a family meeting with patient &apos;s daughter and spouse , along with primary oncologist , Dr. Tomedankell Bile , attending physician , Dr. Mellerny Close , and house staff , was held to discuss patient &apos;s critical condition and inability to prevent progression of skin , sinus and neurological Acanthamoeba infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy .
Decision was made to withdraw aggressive measures of care , with priority on patient &apos;s comfort .
Pentamidine , itraconazole , Levaquin , acyclovir and GCSF were discontinued , along with other medications nonessential to patient &apos;s comfort .
DNR / DNI status initially established early during hospital stay remained in effect .
The patient was made comfortable with morphine for pain and for air hunger , and sinus suctioning was continued to relieve congestion , in conjunction with continuation of nasal sprays .
Tylenol was continued to control fevers and prednisone was continued to control inflammation and prevent precipitation of adrenal insufficiency .
Such measures have been continued through December 3 , and patient remains comfortable through this time .

Brief Hospital Course :
Patient was a 75 year old right handed male with past medical history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin , coronary artery disease , hyperlipidemia , dementia with sudden onset left sided weakness , dysarthria .
Head CT demonstrated a large right intracerebral hemorrhage , centered around basal ganglia and putamen .
We felt this was likely secondary to hypertension .
While still in the emergency department , he had rapid decompensation necessitating intubation for airway protection .
Examination post intubation but off intubations showed clinical evidence of elevated intracranial pressure and brainstem compression .
The overall prognosis was guarded .
He was admitted to the Neurology / Neurosurgery ICU .
He was loaded with Mannitol and Dilantin in the emergency room .
He was evaluated by the Neurosurgery service and they did not feel a surgical intervention or ventriculary drain was warranted .
After arrival in the ICU , patient was followed with neuro checks every 1 hour .

CXR shows diffuse b/l infiltrates R > L and pt was found to have a bandemia .
LDH was 511 .
Pt received bactrim 500 mg x 1 for possible PCP .
Lillian R. / hypoxic respiratory distress .
During admission , became steadily more SOB , increasing lethargy .
12-20 satting initially ~ 90% on 40% face mask .
ABG 7.45/33/57 .
He was switched to a 100% NRB mask and ABG was 7.47/31/80 .
On floor on day of transfer 7.25/50/70 on 100% NRB .
During evaluation pt responsive to sternal rub but could not follow commands .
Intubated for failure to protect airway , transferred to ICU .
Brief Hospital Course :
Impression :
71 yo m w/ astrocytoma on xrt and chemotx , who p/w 1 wk h/o productive cough , sick contact , hypoxic , now intubated , w/ increasing infiltrates b/l .
1) Resp failure - pt admitted w/ primarily hypoxic respiratory failure .
Following admission to the floor the pt developed increasing hypoxia and somnolence , requiring intubation on HD 5 .
Pulm had previously been consulted and felt that presentation was c/w PCP , Joann started on Bactrim .
Previously treated for CAP as outpt but hypoxia continued to progress .
Similar lack of improvement w/ additional broad spectrum coverage following admission .
Pt underwent bronchoscopy on 11-22 following transfer to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and intubation ( 7.25/52/70 on 100% NRB ) .
On admission to the ICU the pt ' steroid dose was increased to 8 mg bid 01-07 to a dead space measurement of 50% .
Pt did well in the ICU , w/ his respiratory status steadily improving and was extubated on
01-03 .
He was subsequently tranferred to the floor , where he continued to have a stable oxygen requirement .
Repeat CXR was unchanged from previously in the ICU ( official read noted mild CHF , but pt was continuing to autodiurese and has remained net negative everyday while on the floor .
On discharge the patient has stable O2 req , 90% on RA .
2) astrocytoma - grade II , as per d/w PMD , Dr. Holscher , pt has poor prognosis , but reasonable for ongoing treatment .
Pt has had two recent neg head CT s , so unlikely the etiology of the patient 's MS change .
Pt was continued on keppra during admission for sz px .
Initially he had been on lamotrigine but the was stopped in 01/12 when the pt was noted to be developing a new rash .
Decadron has been steadily tapered since arrival on the floor .
Now continued on 1 mg BID , to complete a 7 day course , which will be tapered to 1 mg qday on 01-15 , and subsequently to 0.5 mg qday x 7 days then to be discontinued .
The patient 's keppra should be continued for sz prophylaxis .
3) MS change - on admission pt was agitated , requiring restraints and antipsychotics , however as he became increasingly hypoxic he became somnolent .
In the ICU the pt remained stuporous , responsive to painful stimuli .
On the floor the patient intially was imporved , but has plateaued , responding to simple commands and verbalizing groans but no real speech .
Improvement has correlated w/ tapering of steroids , one of the causes in the differential .
Pt had multiple head CT s which ruled out progression of astrocytoma .
MRI has been deferred given that the pt currently would not tolerate the procedure .
EEG was w/o evidence of epileptiform activity and c/w toxic encephalopathy .
Plan to continue to follow MS , expect improvement as steroids are continued to be tapered .
4) h/o DVT - cont heparin , previously on enoxaparin x10 days at treatment dose , followed by prophylactic dose .
On admission , the pt was started on treatment doses of enoxaparin .
Upon transfer to the Intensive Care Unit the pt was started on heparin gtt .
Course was c/b one episode of gross hematochezia on 12-28 , w/ concomitant hct drop of ~ 3 pts .
B/L lower ext duplex us and a cta were performed , both of which were negative .
Given that the pt was w/o evidence of DVT it was felt that the risks of anticoagulation in the setting of gross GIB , outweigh the risks of undetected deep vv thrombosis/pe .
Pt was continued on prophylactic heparin .
4) hypersensitivity reaction - on 11-24 pt was noted to have developing rash of abdomen and anterior thighs .
Derm initially reviewed and thought that it was not c/w hypersensitivity rxn .
Over the next the rash progressed , and the patient subsequently began spiking fevers to approx 103 F , c/b hypotension requiring aggressive fluid repletion and pressors , and tachycardia to the
130s .
The patient also developed elevated transaminases and pancreatic enzymes during this time .
On the second day that the rash had been noted , Derm was asked to see again , felt c/w hypersensitivity , bactrim was switched to pentamidine , and lamictal was held .
Pt continued to have elev pancreatic enzymes and pentamidine was switched to clinda/primaquine .
Following discontinuation of the bactrim the patient defervesced , and remained normotensive .
He received one dose of furosemide in the ICU and was transferred to the floor the next day .
On arrival to the floor the patient was noted to have a lacy reticular rash of upper arms , which resolved over the next 48h .
Felt likely 01-07 the sulfa moiety of the furosemide .
Plan for pt to complete total of 28 day course of therapy for PCP , James will be completed on 01-16 .
5) Anemia - previous w/u c/w ACD ( elev ferritin , low transferrin saturation ) .
- transfuse threshold < 24
6) ARF - Cr mildly elevated on tx to ICU , u lytes c/w prerenal azotemia , which resolved w/ IVF .
7) hyponatremia - also hyponatremic on transfer , resolved w/ ivf .
8) CAD - w/ abnl EF , however pt tolerated aggressive fluid resusciation w/o significant hypoxia .
Continued on valsartan , BB continued , statin
9) Nutrition - pt was maintained on TFs via post-pyloric
10) Px : Heparin ( full dose ) , IV PPI
11) Comm : Family very involved at bedside , evaluating rehab today
17) DNR , but may intubate for reversible causes
18) Restraint"

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 68 year old white male who had a seven to eight year history of knee pain .
In 1984 , he had the right knee aspirated and was noted to have some uric acid crystals , although serum uric acid was normal and erythrocyte sedimentation rate .
He continued to have intermittent symptoms and was noted to have some fullness in the suprapatellar pouch .
Plain films taken by his orthopedist in Mongcana Ster Staarv revealed some soft tissue calcification within the medial and lateral compartments of the joint .
an magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrated calcification densities in the suprapatellar bursa region , also with hypertrophia of the synovium .
It was felt that the patient had synovial chondromatosis and would benefit from an open synovectomy and debridement .
He was admitted for that procedure .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He underwent right knee open synovectomy and debridement of synovial chondromatosis on 10-28-93 .
Postoperatively , he has done well .
He is mobilized with the help of physical therapy , on a continuous passive motion machine .
His discharge range of motion is from zero to 40 degrees .
He was on pain medication and he was also on Percocet , but now he can manage without the Percocet .
He is on Coumadin which is to be continued for six weeks ."

DISCHARGE DATE :
2/28/94
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea .
Apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia .
He came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up .
He had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea .
He became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days .
He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this .
He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone .
His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea .
There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia .
Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen .
Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently .
A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions .
He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol .
The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin .
The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection .
He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable .
They agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present .
No autopsy was obtained ."

ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :
09/02/98 sternal debridement .
Bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flap .
Right superiorly based rectus abdominis flap .
Primary closure of wound .
HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
The patient is a 79 year old gentleman with a history of an ascending aortic graft replacement in 1991 for aortic dissection .
At that time the patient 's hospital course was complicated by a sternal wound infection requiring a sternal debridement and subsequent abdominal flap .
The patient was then continued by report on Dicloxacillin for approximately one year following that reconstructive operation .
The patient apparently did well until June 1998 when he noted a bulge in his sternal area .
A ruptured aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm at the junction of the graft and arch was diagnosed and this was subsequently repaired .
The patient then had recurrent bleeding two weeks later which was once again repaired .
However the same problem recurred for a third time and a computer tomogram scan at an outside hospital showed an anterior hematoma .
By report the patient was at that time told that there was no more that could be done for him and was then apparently placed on comfort measures and pain control at the outside hospital .
However the patient was then subsequently transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital upon request of the family on 8/24/98 for further evaluation and possible intervention .
The patient was evaluated by Dr. Rhalt of Dentvailr. Medical Center .
As the patient 's early evaluation the patient underwent an aortogram which showed an ascending aortic graft with bulging flaps and a pseudoaneurysm at the anastomosis of the graft and arch just below the great vessels .
There was no evidence for a definite leak but there was evidence for gas bubbles in the anterior posterior distal ends of the grafts consistent with an infectious process .
At the same time the patient was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who upon culturing the patient 's sternal drainage switched the patient from intravenous Unasyn to Levofloxacin for what appeared to be Citrobacter and Diphtheroids in the wound cultures .
Subsequent to starting this antibiotic regimen the patient 's wound drainage appeared to subside .
Given all the findings on the aortogram and the subsequent chest computer tomogram scan it was discovered that the patient 's only real surgical option for cure was a risky operation that involved removal and replacement of the aortic graft probably with homograft and long term antibiotic coverage as well as a plastic surgical reconstructive procedure .
The patient understood the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and was willing to proceed .
The patient otherwise complained of no angina , no shortness of breath , no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no edema , no palpitations or symptoms of syncope .
He did report a 20 lbs weight loss over the last several months .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was initially admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Service under Dr. Rhalt .
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit given the patient 's precarious condition .
Over the next several hospital days the patient underwent aortogram as well as chest computer tomogram as outlined earlier .
The patient was also seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service as well as the Cardiology Service who assisted in managing the patient 's intermittent hypertension .
The patient was also seen preoperatively in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service for potential sternal reconstruction .
After lengthy discussions with the patient and the patient 's family as well as the various consultant services it was decided that the patient was a viable candidate for aortic root replacement procedure using homograft .
This was obtained on 08/30/98 by Dr. Niste Rhalt of the Cardiac Surgical Service .
The patient was then subsequently taken to the Operating Room on 08/31/98 with the preoperative diagnosis of ascending aortic graft infection .
The procedure performed was homograft replacement of the ascending aorta with omentopexy and an open chest .
The aortic perfusions were via the femoral artery with venous return by the femoral vein .
The cardiopulmonary bypass time was one hour and 49 minutes .
The graft used was a homograft .
The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well and was transferred intubated to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit with his chest open .
The immediate postoperative plans were for a short Intensive Care Unit stay and subsequent plastic surgical reconstruction of the patient 's sternum .
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .
There he continued to be hemodynamically stable .
Of note , intraoperatively multiple tissue cultures had been sent .
In the Intensive Care Unit the patient was kept intubated and sedated until 09/02/98 which was postoperative day no. 1 following the homograft replacement .
On that day the Plastic Surgical Service performed further sternal debridement and subsequent reconstruction using bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps and right superiorly rectus abdominis flap to cover the patient 's sternal wound with subsequent primary closure of that wound .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications .
A number of indwelling closed suction drains were left in place so as to drain the bed underneath the muscle flaps .
The patient was then transferred back to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .
At this point the patient continued to followed by Infectious Disease Service and continued to be on intravenous antibiotics which included Vancomycin and Levofloxacin .
The Operating Room cultures at that point were positive for Crinobactermium with sputum cultures being sensitive for yeast and gram positive cocci in clusters .
Over the next postoperative day the patient was awakened and weaned to extubate without significant difficulties .
The patient 's subsequent postoperative course was characterized by persistent hypertension which required a significant amount of antihypertensives including Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day , Captopril 100 mg po three times a day , as well as Procardia .
The patient otherwise continued to do well and was becoming more oriented as time went on and as his blood pressure was brought under control .
Subsequently on postoperative day no. 8 in the Intensive Care Unit the patient was felt to be ready for transfer to the Cardiac Surgical Inpatient Service .
The patient continued to be followed by the Infectious Disease Service who felt that the patient 's Jackson Pratt drains needed to stay in as there was still some significant drainage from them .
As per the Infectious Disease Service the patient was continued on Levofloxacin , Vancomycin as antibiotic coverage .
However on 09/08/98 the Infectious Disease Service was made aware that the patient 's intraoperative cultures had also grown out Mycoplasma humilius .
Given this finding it was felt that the patient would certainly need long term intravenous antibiotics to include at least six weeks of Vancomycin and then subsequent Levofloxacin for the Citrobacter and Mycoplasma as well .
The patient was scheduled for peripherally inserted central catheter line placement knowing that he was going to need long term intravenous antibiotics .
This was placed on postoperative day no. 9 without any difficulty .
At the same time the patient continued to be stable on his antihypertensive regimen .
He was becoming more mobile and was taking a high protein high calories diet which he tolerated well .
He continued to be afebrile and otherwise very stable .
On postoperative day no. 12 the patient was noted to have fallen and subsequently dislocating the PIP joint of his left middle finger .
Subsequent hand x-rays obtained showed no evidence of fracture but the patient was seen in consultation by the Plastic Surgery Hand Service .
The patient will benefit from splinting of his finger while the swelling subsided and subsequent early mobilization to prevent any rigidity in that joint .
The patient was also seen subsequently in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service who discontinued a number of the patient 's indwelling drains but they felt that others needed to stay while the patient was sent to rehabilitation .
These drains will then be subsequently taken out by Dr. General upon his followup with the patient .
Prior to discharge the patient also underwent an audiogram as a baseline hearing test while the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .
The patient otherwise continued to be hemodynamically stable making good progress .
As a matter of fact the patient made remarkable progress given the severity of his disease condition prior to the operation .
The patient 's condition continued to be improved .
Given this finding the patient was therefore felt to be ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on 09/13/1998 .
In consultation with the Infectious Disease Service the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 66 year old white female with metastatic colon carcinoma with a mass in the left superhilar region , who presents for bronchoscopy , mediastinal exploration and resection .
The patient was in her usual state of health until she experienced the onset of abdominal pain in early 1992 .
In December of 1992 , she underwent a transverse colectomy for colon carcinoma which was Duke &apos;s grade B-II , lymph nodes were negative .
She received postoperative chemotherapy .
In September of 1992 , she underwent an exploratory laparotomy because of an increased level of CEA in her blood with the presence of a liver abnormality on computerized tomography scan .
The exploratory laparotomy was negative .
She continued to have a rise in her CEA level which prompted a further work up .
In September of 1993 , an abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was negative and in June of 1993 , she had a negative bone scan .
In December of 1994 , a thoracic computerized tomography scan showed a four centimeter soft tissue mass on the left suprahilar region , adjacent to the aortopulmonary window .
She also experienced increased hoarseness over the preceding months , which was due to left vocal cord paralysis .
She also complains of increased shortness of breath for the preceding month and now presents for mediastinal exploration and resection of her probable metastatic mass .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on January 3 , 1994 where she underwent a median sternotomy with removal of her mediastinal mass .
This mass was situated in the aortopulmonary window and was sent to pathology .
The frozen section analysis revealed this to be adenocarcinoma , metastatic disease from the colon most likely .
She had a chest tube placed intraoperatively and another placed postoperatively in the recovery room , for what was presumed to be a left pleural effusion .
This tube drained only a small amount of fluid and it was likely that the effusion was made to look more severe in the presence of left hemidiaphragm elevation .
This additional chest tube was removed the following day .
Her postoperative hematocrit was 31 , compared to a preoperative level of 43 .
Her postoperative recovery was really quite remarkable .
Mediastinal chest tube was removed on postoperative day three .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on postoperative day six ."

OPERATIONS / PROCEDURES :
Dobutamine stress test , cardiac ultrasound , EGD , chest x-ray , PICC placement .
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus , hypertension , COPD , hypercholesterolemia , depression and CHF who was lying in bed on the night prior to admission when she developed left-sided chest pain located in the mid-breast region with some fluttering her chest .
The patient radiated down her left arm associated with some nausea , no shortness of breath , cough , vomiting , diarrhea .
She slept through the night , woke with persistent pain .
She went with her sister &apos;s husband to La Community Hospital where she was given sublingual nitroglycerin with complete relief of pain .
She refused ambulance to the Emergency Room and was driven to Well General Hospital Emergency Room by her sister .
She arrived pain free .
She was given Aspirin , Lopressor and Insulin for hyperglycemia .
EKG was unchanged compared to the prior EKG several months ago .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Team Four for cardiac monitoring and ruling out for MI .
Hospital course by system :
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient ruled out for MI by cardiac markers .
The patient was set to go for a dobutamine stress test on 11/16/04 given her history of COPD , but the stress portion was canceled when she was down there due to fever and hypotension .
The next day , she underwent a cardiac echo ( transthoracic echocardiogram ) .
This echo showed LV ejection fraction of 50% with no wall motion abnormality .
However , the right ventricular was diffusely hypokinetic .
It was suboptimally imaged , so there was no RVSP given .
The patient also suffered a hypotensive episode while in the endoscopy suite for her EGD on 11/17/04 .
This responded to fluid bolus .
The patient was then transferred to Medicine Team D given her tenuous hemodynamic status .
The patient , several days later 11/23 , underwent another dobutamine stress test .
This stress test , although complicated by hypotension again , to the 60 &apos;s or 70 &apos;s was completed and there was some mild anterior septal thinning , but no evidence of ischemia and an EF from this test was 76% .
Clearly , the patient &apos;s hemodynamic vascular status was very sensitive to dobutamine .
2. Infectious Disease :
On hospital day #2 , the patient was noted to have increased dyspnea on exertion .
The next day she developed a fever and she was started on levofloxacin for a potential UTI .
She continued to have low-grade fevers and on the next day , 11/17/04 , her chest x-ray showed possible new right upper lobe infiltrates .
She was then started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin .
Her urine legionella antigen was negative .
On 11/22/04 , she was noted to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum .
She was started on vancomycin for this .
These bacteria turned out to be MRSA and she was continued on her vancomycin .
She had PICC line placed on the day prior to discharge for home vancomycin administration .
3. GI :
The patient had an episode of nausea on the morning of 11/16/04 associated with some cough , apparent emesis .
GI was consulted for an EGD , however , while she was in the Endoscopy Suite , as mentioned above , she had a hypotensive episode , which responded to some fluid boluses .
Finally , on the day prior to discharge , she was stabilized to the point that she could have her EGD .
The EGD did show three esophageal ulcers that were localized and apparent suggestion of pill esophagitis .
Her stomach and duodenum were normal and it was suggested that she change her Nexium doses to daily and that she also drink plenty of fluids and water with meals , sit upright when she would eat her meals to decrease the chance of pills eroding her esophagus .
4. Shortness of breath :
As mentioned above , the patient did develop MRSA pneumonia that was started to be treated with vancomycin and she did also develop an oxygen requirement the day prior to discharge .
At most , her oxygen requirement was 4-5 liters and on the day prior to discharge , she was satting well on two liters of nasal cannula .
This was thought to be due to her pneumonia ; however , with her right ventricular hypokinesis , it is also possible that she may have an element of pulmonary hypertension and may warrant further investigation as an outpatient , for example , with chest CT .
5. Derm :
Several days prior to discharge , the patient developed some erythematous rash under her left breast and left side that was thought to be due to yeast .
She was started on some Miconazole Cream .
The rash was always localized to her left side , sometimes extending down to her leg , but never on the right side .
The rash appeared to be resolving by the time of discharge ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 20 year old black female who was a pedestrian when struck by a car at apparent high speed .
There was apparent loss of consciousness at the scene and significant deformity of the anterior portion of the motorvehicle with positive starring of the windshield .
The patient was conscious on the scene when evaluated by EMT &apos;s but at the scene , the patient was apparently paraplegic below the umbilicus with absence of movement and sensation below the umbilicus .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
A Neurosurgery consultation was obtained , and it was their impression that the patient &apos;s paraplegia might possibly represent a cord concussion , and recommended treatment with intravenous steroids for 24 hours .
The patient &apos;s paraplegia resolved by the morning of her second hospital day , and she maintained 5/5 motor strength in all groups .
A Urology consultation was obtained , and it was recommended that an IVP be obtained .
This was obtained on the day of discharge , however , due to residual contrast in the colon from the patient &apos;s prior abdominal CT scan , the exam was postponed after a scout film was obtained .
The patient fell well on the day of discharge .
She remained afebrile throughout her hospital course .
Additionally on the night before discharge , flexion and extension views of the lumbosacral spine were obtained , and showed no fracture or instability ."

NEUROLOGY
History of Present Illness :
The patient is a 83 yo R-handed man with a history of multiple intracranial hemorrhages during the last few years , pacemaker , hyperlipidemia , arrhythmia who now presents with gradual decline in gait and slowing of mentation over the last week .
The patient had a fall about ten days ago , when he was walking the dog .
The leash got wrapped around his legs .
According to his wife he had a small abrasion on the top of his head , but nothing major .
He did not complain about a headache .
He was at baseline with respect to his gait ( at baseline unsteady , though he refuses to walk with a walker ) and his mentation ( at baseline difficulties with memory since months ; keeps forgetting appointments ).
Then about a week ago , the patient and his wife noted that his gait became even more unsteady , though he did not fall .
He also had difficulties navigating through his apartment , having difficulties finding the fridge for example .
They were concerned that the fall might have caused another bleed , as had happened in the past , and this prompted them to come to the Deanna .
No headache , neckpain , nausea , vomiting or focal weakness / numbness .
Review of systems : denies any fever , chills , weight loss , visual changes , hearing changes , dysphagia , tingling , numbness , bowel-bladder dysfunction , chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , dysuria , hematuria , or bright red blood per rectum .
His legs have been feeling weaker , bilaterally since the last week .
Brief Hospital Course :
The patient is a 83 yo man with a history of past intracranial hemorrhages ( most recent 07-01 with R-frontal hemorrhage ) who presented with gradually slowing of mentation and increased gait instability since one week .
On initial exam the patient was not oriented to time , seemed somewhat slow , and had difficulties generating a list of animals .
His cranial nerves and strength were full , and the sensory exam showed mildly decreased vibration and proprioception in both LE , suggesting peripheral neuropathy .
A CT was performed in the Deanna that showed a new significant R-frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the same location as the prior bleed .
The patient was seen by both neurology and neurosurgery , and the two teams agreed that the etiology seemed to be related to underlying amyloidosis .
During the last admission the question of a mass underlying a hemorrhage in the R-frontal region was raised .
The location of the hemorrhage was not felt to be typical for hypertensive bleed ( cortical ) and it was felt to be unlikely that the recent fall was related to the bleed .
The patient could not undergo an MRI due to his pacer .
He was admitted to the neurology ICU for closer monitoring and was stable overnight - BP was initially elevated and required a labetalol drip for < 24 hours , then stabilized .
The goal SBP of < 150 was achieved .
Coags and UA were checked and were normal .
For the question of seizure activity associated with a cortical bleed , he was started prophylactically on Keppra ( given questionable allergy to dilantin ) , at 500 mg bid ; no seizure activity was seen .
This medication should be continued as an outpatient at least while the bleed has time to clear up , with planned titration up to 1000 mg bid on 04-05 .
Head CT repeated on 03-30 was unchanged , and the patient remained stable with only very suble focal exam findings ( very mild right pronator drift ) as well as his persistently poor memory related to dementia .
The plan after 24 hours was to transfer him to the floor , but the hospital was full and he never got a bed .
Cardiovascularly , lipitor and amiodarone were continued .
He could not get an MRI due to his pacemaker .
There were no telemetry events , and he ruled out by enzyme .
Pulmonlologically , his chest xray was negative and he complained of no breathing problems .
Endocrinologically , BG was monitored to improve outcome in ICU setting though he had no history of DM .
Of note , Hba1c done 03-04 was slightly elevated ( "" borderline DM "" ) at 6.3 ; this was repeated and was still pending on the day of discharge .
Ins / outs and electrolytes were monitored and were not abnormal ; he was on a bowel regimen , VD boots and PUD prophylaxis with protonix during the admission .
Walking was assessed later and the patient was unstable on his feet .
PT was asked to see him for this gait problem .
Brandon felt well and was seen by PT who suggested a rehab/Hahnemann Hospital ( Worcester ) to work on walking with the eventual goal of returning to assisted living with his wife when walking improved .
Follow-up was arranged with neurosurgery in 5-6 weeks with repeat head ct to be arranged by neurosurgery office to make sure blood has cleared , and if indicated , to look for a possible underlying lesion ( although unlikely ) ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 72 year old white male with a history of coronary artery disease , status post a four vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1983 , pulmonary hypertension , hepatitis C positive cirrhosis history with history of portal hypertension and status post an upper gastrointestinal bleed on 4-10-98 , who presents from Sondi Memorial for work up of pulmonary infiltrates , acute renal failure and pulmonary hypertension .
The patient presented to Sondi Memorial on 4-10-98 with fatigue and fall , found to have a hematocrit of 29 , baseline 37 .
The patient was transfused two units and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy done where it showed gastritis , candidal esophagitis and portal hypertensive gastropathy without varices .
A colonoscopy showed anteriordysplasia , no bleeding was seen .
The patient was discharged after one week on iron sulfate .
On 4-24 , the patient was seen again at Sondi Memorial when he experienced at home a fall , no loss of consciousness , positive substernal chest pain , pleuritic pain , shortness of breath and cough .
He went to Sondi Memorial where he ruled out for myocardial infarction and was found to have a left lower lobe infiltrate / pneumonia , started on cefuroxime .
His respiratory condition continued to deteriorate despite aggressive chest physical therapy for possible blood , given Lasix for congestive heart failure , became hypotensive , hypoxic and intubated .
The patient was found to have expanding pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray , developed acute renal insufficiency with minimal urine output , less than 10 cc an hour , started on dopamine for hemodynamic instability .
An echocardiogram was obtained on 4-26 which showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal _____ left ventricular function , severe right ventricular dilatation with septal hypokinesis and flattening with a question of right ventricular apical clot raised with mild aortic stenosis , severe tricuspid regurgitation and increased pulmonary artery pressure of approximately 70 millimeters , consistent with fairly severe pulmonary hypertension .
Blood cultures x two sent off with no growth .
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction with flat creatine kinases and he was sent to Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital for further work up .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
At the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital he was quite hypotensive , requiring dopamine at 1,000 , Levo at 12 .
His chest x-ray showed diffuse patchy infiltrates on left lung with left upper lung patchy infiltrates and right hemidiaphragm elevated , consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome from possible pneumonia .
A urinalysis was obtained which showed blood , urine sediment was active with positive dysmorphic cells , red cell casts , and 1+ albumin with mild protein uria .
The patient had ANCA , anti-GBM , anti-streptolycin , ANA , UPEP , SPEP , renal ultrasound , hepatitis C cryoglobulin sent out .
He had a bronchoscopy immediately done which showed no fresh blood , just old clot and a pulmonary arterial line placed in the right internal jugular vein .
Question of pulmonary-renal syndrome was raised .
The patient subsequently deteriorated over time , was started on CVVH and suffered significant complications without improvement of his pulmonary / renal situation .
A family meeting was held on 5-2-98 and it was decided that the patient should be made comfort care only .
All CVVH and the ventilator was removed and the patient spontaneously passed away on 5-2-98 , at 4:55 p.m.

History of Present Illness :
68 year old right handed man with multiple vascular risk factors , including 2 previous strokes and two myocardial infarctions , hypertension and hypercholesterolemia , who presents with acute onset right sided hemiplegia and dysarthria .
He went to the bathroom on his own at 6:12 AM and then called for help at 6:15 AM .
His wife found him with weak right leg , flaccid right arm , and severe dysarthria .
She called 911 and he was brought to Hahnemann General Hospital Lydia .
ROS :
Wife denies any recent bleeding , surgeries , or upper respiratory infection .
Brief Hospital Course :
Assessment :
68M with multiple vascular risk factors presents with acute onset right-sided hemiparesis and dysarthria , aphasia concerning for acute left MCA infarct .
Patient arrived in Daniel within 3 hours of symptom onset and head CT showed no evidence of bleed .
However , as wife had not seen patient before he became symptomatic , there was some concern that he had symptoms earlier than 6 am , and therefore would be outside the 3 hour window for TPA .
MRI was performed which showed diffusion abnormalities but no hyperintensity on T2 / FLAIR imaging supporting the acute onset .
Therefore , IV tpa thrombolytics were administered within 3 hours of symptom onset .
Within minutes the patient showed decreased right sided weakness and improved from a global aphasia to an anterior aphasia picture .
Given the likely embolic etiology of infarct , carotid doppler and TTE were performed .
Doppler revealed no hemodynamically significant lesions bilaterally .
Echo did not reveal potential source of emboli , but showed striking left ventricle akinesis and hypokinesis presumbly due to past MI x 2 .
Given that the stroke occurred while taking aspirin and plavix , and given the severe akinesis of the left ventricle , we decided to initiate anticoagulation with warfarin to help prevent future strokes .
Anticoagulation therapy was initiated with heparin and coumadin beginning on the evening of 2016-08-23 .
The patient and his wife , a nurse , were educated on low molecular wt heparin , which was started in the hospital on 2015-08-26 with close follow-up scheduled with Dr. Demmert of the Wareham VA primary care clinic the next morning .
His depakote was continued for his bipolar disorder .
On discharge , strength was nearly intact in the limbs , though he still had a right-sided facial droop .
Additionally , he still had mild dysarthria and mild anterior aphasia .
Additionally , risk factor modification was continued .
Lipid panel was checked and showed good control of lipids on his home dose of zocor .
Patient has no history of diabetes , and fasting glucose was 78 , but A1C was slightly elevated at 5.9 .
He may need further glucose monitoring in the future .
His home hypertensive medications were held while in the hospital to help increase cerebral perfusion and prevent further ischemia .
They will be restarted on discharge .
Speech therapy was also consulted , and recommended oupatient speech therapy .
Similarly , outpatient PT was recommended for his gait difficulties from his previous strokes .
Residual deficits include right side facial droop from previous stroke and moderately severe dysarthria and anterior aphasia with word finding difficulties ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 52 year old female with gravida 3 para 3 who presents with complains of abdominal pain and enlarged ovary by ultrasound .
The patient is also complaining of several years urinary incontinence .
The patient &apos;s recent history is also notable for a Papanicolaou smear which revealed somomabodies .
The patient also had vaginal bleeding in April 1992 following radiation therapy .
The patient initially presented with hypercalcemia and underwent a parathyroidectomy on June 22 , 1993 .
It was at that time that her abnormal Papanicolaou smear was obtained .
The patient is now admitted for exploratory laparotomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was judged to be at risk secondary to her history of somomabodies and vaginal bleeding .
Her differential diagnosis included ovarian cancer .
The patient was admitted on July 9 to the operating room .
She underwent an open laparoscopy , total abdominal hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , lysis of adhesions , Birch procedure , and suprapubic Foley catheter placement and Jackson-Pratt drain placement .
The estimated blood loss was 300 cc .
There were no complications during the procedure and the patient returned to the recovery room in stable condition .
Postoperatively , the patient did well .
Her calcium was followed daily and repleted as needed .
Her Jackson-Pratt drain was removed on postoperative day number two .
The patient had a temperature of 101.6 on postoperative day two .
Her lungs revealed coarse breath sounds .
She was encouraged to ambulate and deep breath .
The patient was started on nebulizer treatment .
The patient did well and her suprapubic tube was clamped starting on postoperative day four .
The patient voided spontaneously .
Clamping continued until postoperative day six .
At this time , her post-void residuals range from 2 cc to 25 cc .
The suprapubic tube was therefore discontinued .
By postoperative day six , the patient was also tolerating a regular diet and passing flatus .
A chest X-ray was performed secondary to the patient &apos;s coarse breath sounds , however , the chest X-ray was clear except for a small amount of atelectasis .
The patient was discharged home .
final pathology revealed right Fallopian tube and ovary with benign paratubal cysts and adhesions .
The cervix revealed squamous metaplasia .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 47 year old patient of Dr. Laymie Fournier and Dr. Leebjescobe in Co In Saorlirv Frea , West Virginia who was well until a bout of double pneumonia in May 1992 , at which time he was hospitalized at Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center .
He also has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus .
He had a transient episode of headache and disorientation at that time .
A CT and MRI scan corroborated multiple cerebral infarcts .
He was started on aspirin .
He has a family history of hypertension as well .
He was also placed on Vasotec .
A Holter monitor showed ventricular ectopy .
A thallium stress test showed tachycardia and severe dyspnea as well as a fall in blood pressure with low level exercise .
An echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis .
Accordingly he was referred for further evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory , where he was noted initially to have a pulmonary wedge pressure of 45 with a pulmonary artery pressure of 82/40 .
This lowered with IV nitroglycerin .
Selective coronary angiography showed an occluded right coronary artery in its midportion .
He had an 80% distal left main , a 90% proximal circumflex , and multiple significant lesions in the LAD .
His left ventricle ejection showed diffuse hypokinesis .
The situation was reviewed with his wife , Sligh .
She noted that he was actively working full time and was a sales representative at the Leigh and lives at home with her and his daughter , age 18 .
It was felt that , because of the evidence of congestive heart failure and the critical left main lesion , he should be admitted for further evaluation .
Indeed , he was treated with diuretics and nitrates along with cessation of his aspirin , and he was put on IV Heparin .
He stabilized over the weekend .
He was noted to have some ventricular ectopy on Holter monitor .
He developed epigastric pain on 07/31 which previously had been ignored but in retrospect was probably his anginal equivalent .
He also had multifocal ventricular ectopy at that time .
He had some further anterolateral ST segment changes .
Therefore , he did have unstable angina with his critical coronary anatomy .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Electrophysiology service , Dr. Slusslashgodle , who said that he had no indication for patch placement at the time of surgery .
On 08/02/93 , an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed ; then , Dr. Thorebreutz took him to the operating room , where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting .
He had a left internal mammary artery graft of the LAD , a single saphenous vein to the right coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow .
A paraphimosis was noted and treated by Dr. Ryna Jescdrig .
After surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia .
He was able to be rapidly weaned and extubated .
He had good hemodynamics .
He had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats .
His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
He was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus .
On 08/05 it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous Heparin and indeed , when Heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal .
Therefore , he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to Heparin .
He remained in normal sinus rhythm .
He did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which were clinically stable .
He had a right bundle branch block .
He is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ACE inhibitors , Digoxin , Coumadin , and aspirin .
Therefore he was able to be discharged home .
He understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ; these will be done in Grovea Co Terburgperv Portnew ."

The chest pain was considered mild but persistent with episodes lasting twenty minutes .
He came to the emergency room with chest pain on July 22 , 1994 , relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin .
No history of nausea and vomiting or shortness of breath .
Denies fevers , pleuritic chest pain or cough .
The electrocardiogram showed pseudonormalization of T waves in V1 through V6 and Q waves in V1 through V3 .
The patient &apos;s past cardiac history is significant for an anterior myocardial infarction in September of 1993 and a non-Q wave myocardial infarction in February of 1993 .
The patient in September of 1993 had 3-4 millimeter ST segment elevation in V1 through V4 and depression in II , III , and AVF .

Endoscopy with biopsy revealed gastric carcinoma , poorly differentiated , within the body of the stomach along the greater curvature .
She was subsequently referred to Dr. Ko for a possible resection of this carcinoma .
She reports a 10 pound weight loss over the past several months .
She denies any abdominal pain .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Service of Dr. Fede A. Duhenile .
On 1/12/92 she was taken to the operating room where she underwent a neart total gastrectomy with a retrocolic Bill-Roth II gastrojejunostomy reconstruction .
In addition a small ventral hernia was noted upon abdominal exploration within a previous surgical incision .
This was repaired .
A needle jejunostomy catheter was placed at the time of her operation to facilitate postoperative nutrition .
With regards to the cancer , there was a large mass along the greater curvature in the body of the stomach , and several perigastric lymph nodes which were taken with the specimen .
In addition , there were at least two lymph nodes within the porta hepatis which were dissected free and taken en bloc with the specimen .
The remainder of her abdomen was unremarkable without evidence of metastatic spread elsewhere , including the liver .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in good condition .
The patient 's postoperative course was for the most part unremarkable .
Her wounds healed well without incident and the needle jejunostomy tube was utilized on the first postoperative day right up until the time of discharge , infusing Vivonex T.E.N.
The patient tolerated this without difficulty .
The patient 's nasogastric tube was removed on the 3rd postoperative day , and with the passage of flatus and good bowel sounds noted , she was started on a liquid diet which was advanced slowly .
She was seen by the dietician and was advised with regard to needing numerous small meals during the day rather than 3 larger meals as she previously was used to .
Her ambulation and mobilization increased gradually and by the time of discharge she was walking in the halls without assistance .
As mentioned , her wounds healed well without incident and the staples were removed on the 10th postoperative day just prior to discharge .
She had some difficulties with confusion in the early postoperative period which were attributable to her advanced age and a sundowning effect .
These problems resolved by the 4th or 5th postoperative day and she remained lucid and alert for the remainder of her hospital stay .
Surgical pathology report was completed prior to discharge which revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma ulcerating and extending through the wall into the serosa of the stomach .
Metastatic carcinoma was present in 3 of 3 lymph nodes .
The gastric resection margins were free of carcinoma .
The patient was set for discharge on the 11th postoperative day doing well .
On the day prior to discharge she complained of some dysuria , a urine specimen was obtained , which showed numerous white cells consistent with a urinary tract infection .
She was started empirically on Bactrim , while culture and sensitivity results were pending and remained pending at the time of this dictation .
She will be discharged to home and will be seen in follow-up by her regular physicians as well as Dr. Ko ."

OTHER PROCEDURES :
Echocardiogram , neurovascular ultrasound .
HISTORY :
Patient is a 73-year-old retired cook with a history of cervical myelopathy , who is admitted for new left hemiparesis .
He had undergone C-spine surgery for spinal stenosis with a question of myelopathy and radiculopathy in 1992 with residual spastic paresis and monoparesis of the left upper extremity , but was ambulatory until a day prior to admission .
At his baseline , he was able to perform limited tasks with his left upper extremity , and was clearly able to move his hand and able to ambulate .
He also at baseline has had urinary and fecal urgencies / incontinence .
His history is now that he has had a week of progressive left upper extremity weakness , to the point of being unable to move the left hand and one day of being unable to walk secondary to left leg weakness with a marked tendency to fall leftward .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Mr. Finger was admitted for what appeared to be a stroke syndrome involving his left middle cerebral artery territory .
He underwent neurovascular doppler studies which showed no significant change in either common carotid or in the left common internal ophthalmic system .
However , there were hemodynamic changes which raised the question of right siphon disease .
He had normal cervical vertebral arteries .
Transcranial dopplers showed no abnormalities in the ophthalmic siphon systems , distal vertebrals , or proximal basilar artery .
The proximal , middle , anterior and posterior cerebral arteries , however , could not be insinuated .
Over the course of the first hospital day , the patient &apos;s exam deteriorated in a manner that appeared to be blood pressure dependent .
He had been started on Heparin from the time of his admission .
A computerized tomography scan had showed multiple lacunes , right greater than left , and the deep gray and white matters suspicious for proximal middle cerebral artery stem occlusion or stenosis .
MRI / MRA was performed with diffusion weighted images , showing subcortical white matter and basal ganglia infarcts , but preserved middle cerebral artery territory cortex .
Because of his blood pressure , dependence of his left sided extremities , the lower leg specifically , he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he underwent hypertensive therapy for several days .
His systolic blood pressure goal was initially 170-190 , which he was able to achieve spontaneously for the most part .
However , due to the absence of clear benefit at this level , and further deterioration in his left sided strength , this goal was increased and Neo-Synephrine was added to his regimen to achieve mean arterial pressures in the 110-120 range .
This strategy and its incumbent risks , particularly in a patient on Heparin , were discussed at length with both the patient and his family , who were very clear in wanting to proceed with all possible efforts to save the use of his left leg .
While in the Intensive Care Unit , his strength deteriorated from being able to hold his left leg off the bed up to several inches to loosing virtually all distal extremity strength , and having a 2-3/5 power in his proximal left leg groups .
He also , as Neo-Synephrinewas tapered , developed mild sensory findings , in particular diminished large fiber sensibility in his left hand , although he at times , including near the end of his Intensive Care Unit stay had a right gaze preference .
In terms of exploring his visual space , he was able to look to the left , and it was not possible to elicit clear evidence for a field deficit .
He was followed by speech and swallowing service , who assisted in the management of po intake which gradually improved , although he clearly had problems with manipulation of food in the left side of his mouth and would tend to accumulate a pouch of food in his left cheek .
I should mention that his blood pressure therapy was at times limited by a severe headache , although he also had this off the pressor .
He had several repeat imaging studies during his Intensive Care Unit stay which showed further demarcation , but not extension of his prior infarct , both on computerized tomography scan and DWI images .
Additionally , he had a perfusion , diffusion MR study earlier on , which suggested the presence of viable penumbra , including the overlying cortex .
He was transferred to the regular neurology floor once it became clear that he was not receiving any significant benefit from hypertensive therapy .
At this time , his neurologic exam is notable for hemiplegia of his left arm , severe hemiparesis of his left leg , mild large fiber sensory loss in his left arm , and otherwise fairly intact mental status , cranial nerve function , and right sided motor and sensory function .
We anticipate that he represents a good rehab potential .
He will be discharged to rehab on a regimen of Coumadin 5 mg po today then daily for an INR goal of 2-3 , Ofloxacin 400 mg po bid to be discontinued on 11/05/96 , Dexedrine 5 mg po qd , Omeprazole 20mg po qd , Erythromycin eye ointment OU bid , Heparin at its present rate adjusting per partial thromboplastin time bid , and discontinuing when the Coumadin is therapeutic , Tylenol 650 mg po q4 prn , Colace 100 mg po bid .
Follow up will be with Dr. Tvi Fine of Neurology , and Dr. Doll Grendbly of internal medicine and primary care , shortly after discharge from rehab .

DISCHARGE DATE :
07/16/95
HISTORY AND REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Mr. Mass was a 56 year old white male who was transferred from Vassdiysey Medical Center for rule out pancreatic pseudocyst .
Mr. Mass had a past medical history which included Wegener &apos;s granulomatosis , history of an anterior myocardial infarction , and gallstone pancreatitis .
He was admitted to Vassdiysey Medical Center with severe recurrent pancreatitis , nausea , vomiting , and abdominal pain .
His amylase on admission there was 1,961 .
The patient had two recent admissions for pancreatitis in January 1994 , and August 1994 .
On his current admission , the patient was admitted to Free Medical Center .
His amylase decreased to 51 , and the increased back to 151 on hospital day #10 .
At that time , he spiked a temperature to 103 .
He also became increasingly confused .
A computerized tomography scan done on 4/16/95 showed a large &quot; pseudocyst &quot; .
He was transferred to Ph University Of Medical Center for further surgical evaluation .&apos;
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted , placed on intravenous fluids .
He was continued on his imipenem , intravenously .
The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition .
On 4/17/95 , GI Interventional Radiology performed drainage of the peripancreatic fluid collection .
Approximately one liter of brownish fluid was obtained and sent for culture .
The drainage catheter was left in a pseudocyst .
The patient was evaluated by Cardiology .
A Persantine Thallium study demonstrated a large infarct , involving the posteroseptal , anteroseptal areas .
Left ventricular aneurysm was also noted ; however , no ischemia was seen .
An echocardiogram was done .
The echocardiogram showed terrible left ventricular function , with left ventricular aneurysm .
The right ventricle appeared to be acceptable .
The percutaneous drainage catheter continued to have high output .
The fluid was sent for amylase , which came back 53,230 .
On 4/28/95 , the patient had new onset of abdominal pain .
His white count had bumped from 8.3 on admission to 18.5 , on 4/27 .
A computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed .
Approximately 100 cc.&apos;s of thick brownish material was aspirated through the indwelling catheter .
The computerized tomography scan showed the catheter tip in good position .
Because of the patient &apos;s deteriorating state , the patient was brought to the operating room on 4/28/95 .
An exploratory laparotomy was performed .
The splenic flexure had a purulent exudative process along the antimesenteric surface .
Thus , the splenic flexure and a portion of the descending colon were resected .
The patient underwent a left colectomy with end transverse colostomy , and oversewing of the descending colon .
Drainage of the pancreatic necrosis was also done .
The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well , and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit .
In the Intensive Care Unit , the patient had a prolonged course .
The patient was then extubated on postoperative day #2 , but remained pressor-dependent .
He remained on imipenem , and Vancomycin was also started .
Thereafter , the patient had a long and complicated postoperative course .
He was eventually transferred to the floor , where he remained meta-stable .
He had repeated episodes of hypotension to 80-90 systolic/40-50 diastolic .
These resolved without incident .
He also had repeated temperature spikes .
After repeated work ups , it was felt that these were probably due to remaining infection in the peripancreatic area .
His drainage tube from the peripancreatic area was gradually advanced , and eventually discontinued .
Mr. Mass was placed on multiple courses of antibiotics .
Most recently , he was on a 28 day course of Vancomycin , ofloxacin , and Flagyl , for blood cultures that were positive for gram positive cocci and enteric and non-enteric gram negative rods .
This 28 day course was completed on 07/15/95 .
The patient was also treated initially with amphotericin-B and then with fluconazole for a computerized tomography guided aspirate of a small fluid collection around his pancreas , which grew Candida albicans .
The patient also had several episodes of fungal cystitis with Torulopsis glabrata , going from his urine .
He was treated with amphotericin-B bladder washes for this .
Mr. Mass was initially anticoagulated for his left ventricular aneurysm .
He remained stable from a cardiac fashion .
He did have problems with po intake .
He had repeated bouts of small-volume emesis that may have been secondary to reflux .
He was treated with a variety of anti-emetics , most recently Granisetron , with only mild success .
He remained total parenteral nutrition-dependent throughout his hospital course .
By the end of June , it became clear that Mr. Mass would require aggressive surgical intervention in order to eradicate his intra-abdominal bursts of intermittent sepsis ; however , long discussions with the patient and his wife , who was his health-care proxy , revealed that they felt that no further aggressive intervention be attempted .
The patient had been made a do not resuscitate do not intubate patient earlier in his hospital stay .
Multiple discussions were held between Dr. Mass , the rest of the surgical team , and the patient &apos;s wife , with this same result .
After discussion with the patient &apos;s primary doctor , Dr. Douet at Vassdiysey Medical Center , it was felt that the patient and his family would be best served if the patient were transferred to Vassdiysey Medical Center .
Of note , given the patient &apos;s do not resuscitate status and the risk for bleeding , the patient &apos;s Coumadin was stopped without incident several weeks before transfer ."

CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 71 - year-old gentleman who was admitted to the St. Anne 's Hospital as a transfer from the Kindred Park View Specialty Hospital of Springfield .
Prior to admission , he had a long and complicated hospital course at the outside hospital .
His hospital course began on 2014-02-13 when he underwent a right carotid endarterectomy for 95% stenosis of the carotid artery .
His postoperative course was complicated by nonspecific T wave changes consistent with myocardial infarction postoperatively as well as hematoma formation .
The hematoma formation was rapidly expanding and he received an emergent surgical airway in the Intensive Care Unit .
This emergent cricothyroidotomy was converted then to a formal tracheostomy .
During his subsequent hospital course , he had an additional CHF exacerbation .
He was medically managed and eventually his tracheostomy was decannulated .
However , just prior to admission to Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary he had another acute decompensation with CHF exacerbation .
This necessitated emergent intubation .
With EKG changes consistent with myocardial infarction , he was transferred to the Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary for further management .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. Knueppel was admitted to the CCU at the Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary .
Upon admission , he was treated for his pneumonia .
He was medically managed for CHF and underwent a cardiac catheterization on 2014-03-06 .
His catheterization revealed 70% stenosis of the distal left main coronary artery , 90% stenosis of the LAD , 80% stenosis of the circumflex , 90% stenosis of OM2 and a proximally occluded right coronary artery .
After reviewing cardiac catheterization data , a consultation was made with Cardiothoracic Surgery who deemed that he was a good candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting .
Over the ensuing days , Mr. Nina CHF was managed by the CCU Team and he received treatment for what was now determined to be a Klebsiella pneumonia .
He was treated with a full course of Zosyn .
On 2014-03-11 , Mr. Knueppel went to the Operating Room with Dr. Streeter .
He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft of four vessels .
He had a saphenous vein graft to his LAD and diagonal in a sequential fashion , saphenous vein graft to his PDA and a saphenous vein graft to his OM .
The procedure was performed by Dr. Streeter and assisted by Dr . .....................
The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication and was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit without complication .
Please see the previously dictated operative note for more details .
Mr. Knueppel had a long postoperative course .
His postoperative course was complicated by hypertension which was managed medically .
During his postoperative course , he did not suffer from any arrhythmias nor did he have any episode of hypotension .
At the time of discharge , he was on a stable antihypertensive regimen appropriate for someone with a decreased ejection fraction .
Mr. Knueppel had had a long protracted period of intubation prior to the operation .
The status of Mr. Nina pulmonary system necessitated a prolonged postoperative intubation .
After a very slow wean from ventilatory support , Mr. Knueppel was successfully extubated on postoperative day number nine .
He continued to be very tenuous from a pulmonary point of view and required frequent chest PT .
For this reason , Mr. Knueppel was kept in the Intensive Care Unit where very close monitoring could be performed .
In addition , he had chest PT performed at very regular intervals by the ICU staff .
His pulmonary status was so tenuous that we were unable to transfer him to the regular patient care floor during his hospitalization .
Mr. Knueppel had an emergent cricothyroidotomy followed by a formal tracheostomy at the outside hospital .
There is much scarring surrounding his larynx .
Such a situation frequently makes it very difficult to swallow without aspirating .
As is expected , Mr. Knueppel failed a swallowing study early on in his Boston Regional Medical Centerr hospital course .
The study was repeated and yet again Mr. Knueppel was unable to swallow without evidence of aspiration .
After a prolonged period of being fed via nasogastric tube , Mr. Knueppel finally had a formal percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed in the Intensive Care Unit .
This was performed on 2014-04-01 , postoperative day number 21 .
This procedure was performed by Dr. Kevin Taussig and assisted by Dr. Carla Solan .
The procedure was performed under endoscopic guidance in the Intensive Care Unit without complication .
Please see the previously dictated operative note for more details .
Mr. Knueppel Robertson a distal radius fracture prior to arriving to the hospital .
This injury had been reduced and casted at the outside institution .
Postoperatively , there was much edema associated in the postoperative course from coronary artery bypass grafting .
His cast was removed by the Orthopedic Service in anticipation of this edema and to avoid compartment syndrome .
The cast was replaced by a plaster splint .
Mr. Knueppel should follow-up with his orthopedic surgeon in the Worcester State Hospital for reassessment of his injury and possible removal of the splint .
By postoperative day number 23 , Mr. Nina pulmonary status was deemed sufficiently stable .
His hypertension was well controlled and he was tolerating tube feeds .
At this point , he was ready to be discharged to rehabilitation ."

History of Present Illness :
The patient is a 78 y/o WF w/a PMH significant for HTN and afib who presented to an OSH w/ complaints of abd pain and nausea .
She was found to have a R ureteral stone w/ resultant hydronephrosis and was transferred to Nantucket Cottage Hospital for ureteral stent placement .
Her INR was found to be elevated when admitted and , in the course of waiting for this to normalize , the patient spiked a temperature to 105 and became hypotensive to the 70s .
She was bolused w/out effect and had little response to neo so she was changed to levophed , given doses of cipro / vanco / gent and transferred to the CMED CSRU for management .
In the CMED , urology was consulted and the patient received a R nephrostomy tube .
However , tube placement was complicated by renal artery puncture , afib , and increased dyspnea .
She was intubated for this hypoxia and treated with lasix , metoprolol , and diltiazem .
She was weaned off her pressors on 02-21 and maintained her pressure w/out additional fluid boluses .
Her sedation was weaned down and she was successfully extubated shortly thereafter .
UCx grew proteus and her abx were changed to levaquin alone and she remained afebrile for > 24 hr on this regimen .
She continued to have trouble with afib and required a dilt gtt on the day prior to call-out to control this rhythm but she was transitioned to PO diltiazem and has been in NSR since this time .
She was restarted on heparin prior to d/c as a bridge to therapeutic coumadin anticoagulation .

She continued to have trouble with afib and required a dilt gtt on the day prior to call-out to control this rhythm but she was transitioned to PO diltiazem on the day of call-out .
1. Sepsis - The patient was septic in the ER and her blood cultures eventually grew proteus .
Her Bcx remained negative throughout her stay .
She was treated with levaquin on the floor and will complete a 14d course at rehab .
She has been afebrile since she was called out to the floor .
2. Ureteral stone - The patient had a nephrostomy tube placed by IR to relieve her hydronephrosis .
She was followed by urology during her stay and will see them again 2 wk after d/c for definitive treatment of her nephrolithiasis .
At this time , urology will coordinate removal of her nephrostomy tube with IR .
Her nephrostomy tube was draining clear yellow urine at the time of d/c .
3. a.fib - The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation controlled with beta blockers at home .
She was treated in the CMED as above .
Once on the floor , the patient had one episode of afib w/ RVR that responded immediately to IV metoprolol .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 48 - year-old woman who was transferred from Shaugnessy-Kaplan Rehab Hospital .
The patient originally presented to her PCP approximately one week prior to admission here with increasing cough , dyspnea and fatigue .
She was given a Z-Pak for treatment along with albuterol .
Despite this , she continued to worsen and became febrile .
So , she was admitted to Shaugnessy-Kaplan Rehab Hospital on 2015-07-10 .
At the hospital , she was started on Rocephin and Levaquin for a right lower lobe pneumonia seen on chest x-ray .
She continued to have increasing respiratory distress with hypoxia .
She was also significantly tachypneic .
At this time , repeat chest x-ray showed bilateral diffuse infiltrates consistent with ARDS .
The patient was intubated and then transferred to Hahnemann General Hospital CMED .
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE :
Respiratory :
On admission , the patient had what appeared to be acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to community - acquired pneumonia .
She was maintained on a ventilator and ventilated according to ARDSNet protocol .
For antibiotic coverage of her pneumonia , she was started on Levaquin , ceftriaxone , and vancomycin .
Over the next two days after admission , the patient 's vent settings were gradually weaned , and she was extubated two days after being transferred to this hospital .
After extubation , the patient was oxygenating well on face mask .
She did continue to have a persistent fairly severe cough ; however , her cough was weak due to abdominal muscle pain from repeated coughing .
The cough was mostly nonproductive .
The patient was breathing comfortably .
As there was no identified bacterial pathogen on any cultures , the patient was continued on the triple antibiotics for first several days of the hospitalization .
She was also on round-the-clock Atrovent and albuterol nebulizers .
Once the patient was transferred out of the ICU and after extubation , the antibiotics were gradually narrowed .
The vancomycin and Levaquin were discontinued after approximately four days in the hospital .
The ceftriaxone was discontinued after four days in the hospital , and the patient was to continue on Levaquin .
The patient had gradual improvement in her oxygenation .
Pain control :
The patient had fairly significant abdominal pain secondary to persistent cough .
She was started on a regimen of MS Contin with oxycodone for breakthrough pain .
This helped her somewhat though she has continued to have difficulty coughing due to the pain .
Tylenol and ibuprofen were also added for better control .
Transaminitis :
The patient was noted to have mild transaminitis on admission .
However , this was felt to be due to her significant infection .
This should continue to be followed as an outpatient to assure that it returns back to normal .
Anemia :
The patient 's reticulocyte count showed inadequate production .

12/16/97
DISCHARGE DATE :
01/16/98
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 53-year-old male with a longstanding history of renal disease with multiple complications and problems related to vascular access and hypercoagulable state .
These culminated in an attempted cadaveric kidney transplant undertaken on 12/16/97 , which was complicated by thrombosis and necrosis of the cadaveric renal vein within 24 hours .
This required a transplant nephrectomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient &apos;s course was subsequently characterized by recurrent pneumonias , possibly due to aspiration , and by hemodynamic instability .
He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from the Transplant Service for ventilatory management in the setting of hypotension .
On transfer , the patient was not sedated , but was unresponsive and extremely dyssynchronous with the ventilator .
The patient was found to have substantial auto PEEP with an elevated dead space .
A pulmonary arteriogram on 01/03/98 demonstrated multiple pulmonary emboli , likely less than one week old , possibly introduced at the time of the renal vein thrombosis of 12/19/97 .
An inferior vena cava filter was placed ; lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative .
The patient required high pressures to ventilate adequately , possibly related to an abdominal compartment syndrome .
The patient had undergone two abdominal procedures following explantation .
The physiology at the time of transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit was consistent with a septic process .
CT scan demonstrated retroperitoneal collection containing both free air and extravasated contrast material .
For the concern of a perforated viscus , the patient was taken to exploratory laparotomy on 01/06/98 , during which the bowel was run without evidence of perforation .
The patient remained unstable .
He was taken to fluoroscopy , where oral contrast was demonstrated to be extravasating through a posterior duodenum .
For this reason , he was taken again to the operating room on 01/08/98 , at which time a gastrojejunostomy was performed with stapling across the gastroduodenal junction , introduction of five Jackson-Pratt drains into the retroperitoneal mass , cholecystotomy tube , gastrostomy tube , and jejunostomy tube .
The patient had an extensive estimated blood loss requiring multiple blood products and fluid resuscitation therapy .
Accompanying this during this period were elevations in liver function studies and amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatic inflammation .
The patient was aggressively treated with fluid resuscitation and pressors for his septic physiology .
There was no evidence of cardiac tamponade or specific underlying coronary dysfunction .
He was treated with appropriate antibiotics for his Serratia pneumonia , as well as for his abdominal process .
The patient was felt to have an underlying hypercoagulable state , thought to be the source for the repeated clots .
Because of the bleeding problems , however , it was felt that full heparinization would not be prudent , and the patient was treated with pneumo-boots and subcutaneous heparin .
Attention was paid to a variety of metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities , which were corrected appropriately .
Nonetheless , Mr. Less continued to remain critically ill with only very transient mild improvement with drainage of additional retroperitoneal fluid .
He remained pressor dependent , as well as dependent upon mechanical ventilatory assistance .
His course was complicated by atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion .
He had an ongoing requirement for high volume resuscitation and was persistently acidotic despite CV-VVH in the face of bicarbonate replenishment .
The patient also appeared to have stool from his Jackson-Pratt site and right oblique incision .
Bloody drainage from his increasingly distended abdomen was noted .
Extensive discussions were carried out with Mrs. Less condition was irretrievable .
It was felt that the patient had continued massive retroperitoneal contamination and probable multiple enteric fistulae from an ischemic bowel .
Dr. Cantsleddjesc felt that no surgical approach to this problem or further intervention or radiologic procedures would be helpful .
All physicians and the family were in agreement that the most appropriate approach was to institute comfort measures .
This was done , and the patient appeared to be comfortable at the time of death with his family at his side on 1/16/98 ."

07/03/1998
Discharge Date :
07/10/1998
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 50 year old man in his usual state of health until two weeks prior to admission when the patient developed epigastric pain after meals .
The next morning , the patient felt dizzy and went to his private medical doctor at Eifro Medical Center , and was found to have elevated bilirubins , alkaline phosphatase , and transaminases .
The patient reported fatigue and nausea , as well as noted coca cola colored urine .
The patient has been constipated with hard stool , but no bright red blood per rectum .
The patient also reported an 18 lb weight loss over the last 4-5 months .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted preoperatively for surgery on 7/4/98 .
The patient &apos;s workup up until that time included a diagnosis of periampullary adenocarcinoma , which was proven by EGD directed biopsy , and a left renal mass , which was biopsied and found to be an oncocytoma .
On 7/4/98 , the patient underwent a Whipple procedure , which proceeded without complications .
Postoperatively , the patient did extremely well and was extubated the following morning .
The NG tube was D/C&apos;d on postoperative day #2 .
The patient was to be transferred to the floor on postoperative day #2 , however , due to the lack of beds , he remained in the ICU until postoperative day #3 .
On postoperative day #4 , the patient began tolerating clear liquids and his diet was advanced as tolerated by postoperative day #6 and 7 .
The patient was out of bed , doing fine , and tolerating a regular diet on 7/10/98 .

Discharge Date :
11/16/2003
SERVICE :
GMS 1 Medical Service .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. GI :
Patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells overnight , the first night after admission and his hematocrit bumped up appropriately .
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout his admission .
He was continued on a proton pump inhibitor and on iron sulfate and vitamin C .
His Coumadin was held at the time given the bleeding , even though it was important to keep his INR 2.5-3.5 , given his artificial valve it was felt that the risk of continued bleeding was to great to continue the Coumadin .
He was subsequently seen by the GI team who performed an upper endoscopy which demonstrated the following :
In the esophagus , there was a small hiatal hernia and in the stomach there is evidence of erosive gastritis of the body of the stomach and the antrum , the mucous appeared edematous .
A small polyp was found in the fundus which stigmata of old bleeding ; an Endoclip was applied to this .
Another polyp was found in the antrum and cold biopsies were obtained there .
In the duodenum , a small AVM was noted in the second portion of the duodenum and was cauterized .
The biopsy subsequently demonstrated a hyperplastic polyp with acute and chronic inflammation and erosion and reactive epithelial changes but no dysplasia .
Also of note , prior to the upper endoscopy , the patient received fresh frozen plasma to reverse his anticoagulation .
Patient remained hemodynamically stable during and after the upper endoscopy and his hematocrit remained above 30 following this until the point of discharge .
His last recorded hematocrit on discharge was 31.3 .
His last BUN and creatinine were 42 and 1.5 with an INR of 2.5 .
Consideration was given to performing a repeat colonoscopy .
This was discussed with the GI Service who felt that this was not necessary given the recent colonoscopy that he had had in 05/2003 .
2. Cardiovascular :
A :
Ischemia :
Patient &apos;s troponin bump was found to be likely to demand ischemia in the setting of his GI bleed , it was not felt that he was having acute coronary syndrome .
On discharge , he was continued on his aspirin , simvastatin and his Lopressor which was initially held , and subsequently restarted .
B :
Rhythm :
Patient continued to be in A-fib. throughout the admission and was restarted on his Coumadin concurrently with heparin .
Heparin was subsequently DCd once his INR reached a therapeutic level between 2.5-3.5 .
His last reported INR on discharge was 2.5 .
C :
Valves :
Patient had , as noted above , his anticoagulation was initially reversed despite his having artificial valves .
However , his Coumadin was subsequently restarted and he achieved therapeutic INR levels before discharge .
D :
Pump :
Patient , during this hospital course , became hypervolemic likely due to his diuretics being held and due to his receiving blood products .
He was diuresed initially with one dose of Lasix and subsequently with one dose of torsemide after it was discovered that he developed thrombocytopenia on a prior admission in reaction to Lasix .
He subsequently was diuresed to a euvolemic state .
Of note , he did not become thrombocytopenic on this admission ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Jadiara Harrison is twin #1 born to a 17 year-old primiparous mother at 31 weeks gestation .
Mother was admitted to the Nantucket Cottage Hospital from Lawrence General Hospital Hospital on 05-01 with cervical effacement and preterm labor .
She was treated with magnesium sulfate .
She had previously been admitted here at the 24th week after a motor vehicle accident .She was treated with tocolysis and betamethasone at that time .
Due to progressing labor and presentation of twins , delivery was by Cesarean section .
Prenatal screens were notable for blood type 0 positive , antibody negative , hepatitis B surface antigen negative , RPR nonreactive .
Rubella status was not documented .
Group B strep status was unknown .
Infant emerged from the breech position .
She was vigorous .
She was given blow-by oxygen and stimulation .
Her Apgars were 7 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes .
She was brought to the CMED CSRU for further evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Respiratory :
On admission , infant did not require supplemental oxygen or respiratory support .
Since that time , Jadiara has always been in room air without requiring supplemental oxygen .
She was noted to have apnea of prematurity , treated with caffeine until 2017-06-04 .
Since that time , she has had very rare spells , with none for over one week by the time of discharge .
Cardiovascular :
She was hemodynamically stable upon admission with normal blood pressures and heart rate .
On day of life 15 , she was noted to have a murmur , eventually prompting evaluation by ECHO .
The ECHO revealed an anomalous left coronary , with one end entering the right ventricular outflow tract and the other end not clearly defined .
It was unable to be delineated whether this represented an anomalous left coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery ( LCAPA ) or a left coronary artery fistula to the pulmonar artery .
The right coronary was prominent , and there appeared to be coronary artery collateral vessels in the posterior apical myocardium .
A small apical muscular VSD was also noted .
Several additional ECHOs were performed , including an ECHO in the cardiology department at HealthSouth Rehab Hospital of Western Mass ., but the anatomy of the left coronary artery could not be further defined .
Due to the risks of coronary ischemia if this represented an LCAPA , the infant was followed with regular ECHOs and EKGs during the remainder of hospitalization , with no evidence of ischemia , valvular regurgitation , or compromised ventricular function .
She will be continued to be followed closely by cardiology as an outpatient , with likely plans for cardiac catheterization and surgical repair when she grows to 3.5 to 4 kg .
Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition :
The infant was initially maintained on IVF , with introduction of enteral feeds on day of life 2 .
She was advanced to full volume enteral feeds by day of life 7 , and then to a maximum caloric density of 28 cals / oz .
Oral feedings were introduced as tolerated .
By the time of discharge , infant is feedign BM or enfamil 24 cals / oz PO ad lib , with adequate intake and adequate weight gain .
Last nutrition labs were on 06-20 with AP of 208 , Ca 10.8 , and Phos 7.4.
Gastrointestinal :
The infant required phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia through day of life 7 , with peak bilirubin of 7 / 0.3 on day of life 3 , and last bilirubin of 4.9 / 0.3 on day of life 9 .
Hematologic / Infectious disease :
CBC and blood culture were obtained upon admission revealing a white blood cell count of 9.0 with 25 polys and 0 bands ; hematocrit was 46.9% and platelets of 222,000 .
Baby received 48 hours of Ampicillin and Gentamycin with negative cultures and a stable clinical course .
Infant was treated with supplemental iron , and did not receive any blood transfusions .
Last Hct was 30.6 on 06-20 with a reticulocyte count of 6.5%.
Neurologic :
Baby has been appropriate for gestational age .
Social :
Mother is 17 years old , and has been accompanied on the majority of her visits by her parents , both of whom are students .
The infant 's maternal grandparents have been very involved in her care .
Sensory :
Initial opthalmologic exam on 06-05 revealed immature retinas in zone 3 , and repeat exam on 06-26 revealed mature retinas bilaterally .
Infant passed hearing screen prior to discharge ."

06/19/1998
Discharge Date :
08/01/1998
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 63 year-old woman transferred from Pre Health on June 19 , 1998 to the Verg Medical Center Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .
On May 12 , 1998 , the patient presented to Pre Health with fever , cough , dyspnea and a chest x-ray revealing a patchy infiltrate in the right lung .
She was treated with Clindamycin and Erythromycin which were changed to Trovan and then transferred to A Hospital .
On May 27 , 1998 , the patient desaturated to 40% with a temperature of 100.5 degrees .
Her oxygen saturations improved to only 92% on 100% face mask and she was admitted to Pre Health Intensive Care Unit .
Chest x-ray there revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with increasing pleural effusion .
A VQ scan was high probability , but no pulmonary angiogram was done and an echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricle with no wall motion abnormality and an ejection fraction of 75% .
On May 24 , 1998 , the patient had a CT scan of the chest which revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates at the right base , mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions .
At this point , a diagnosis of lupus was considered and her ANA was 1:640 and her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .
She was started on a steroid trial at that point .
Her pleural fluid was tapped and it was negative for malignancy .
On June 11 , 1998 , the patient had a video assisted thoracoscopic study of the right lung which revealed chronic interstitial pneumonitis with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like reaction and a chest tube was placed .
The patient was then started on 40 mg of Prednisone q. day .
From May 27 , 1998 through June 19 , 1998 , the patient had a decline in her platelets from 394 to 28 with a stable hematocrit of 32 to 33 and a rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 3.8 .
On June 19 , 1998 , she was transferred to the Verg Medical Center Medical Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1 ) Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia :
The video assisted thoracoscopic study at the outside hospital was consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .
The patient was continued on steroids throughout the course of her stay .
This was changed to Solu-Medrol part way through the course due to her hematologic problems , see below .
By discharge , she was returned to 40 mg of Prednisone q. day times one month to be followed by a slow taper .
The patient &apos;s bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia appeared to improve slowly throughout her hospital course , however on July 12 , 1998 , after starting dialysis ( see below ) , the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen .
Repeat chest x-rays and chest CT scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload given her renal failure and eventually , the patient &apos;s pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks .
At the time of her discharge , the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid 90% .
2 ) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura :
The patient was initially admitted with platelet count of 28 , hematocrit of 32 , LDH of 496 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on her smear .
This was felt to be consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and on June 20 , 1998 , she was started on daily plasma exchange which continued through July 27 , 1998 .
She was also changed to intravenous Solu-Medrol 50 mg q. day which was changed back to 40 mg of Prednisone prior to discharge .
Her platelet count initially rose to a maximum of 159 on July 3 , 1998 , then they steadily fell to a low of 60 on July 20 , 1998 .
Her LDH which peaked at 1255 decreased to the mid 200s , but remained elevated .
She continued to have a few schistocytes on her smear , but it was much decreased .
The patient also required red blood cell transfusions , approximately two units every seven to ten days to maintain her hematocrit .
Eventually , her plasma exchange was tapered to a smaller and smaller dose each day and then discontinued altogether after July 27 , 1998 .
After this , the patient &apos;s platelet count rose to a maximum of 177 on discharge .
It is felt that the patient &apos;s thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has resolved .
She will continue on her Prednisone for one month as above for the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia with a very slow taper .
3 ) Renal :
The patient presented in acute renal failure with a BUN of 101 and a creatinine of 3.7 .
Throughout the month of June , she had a rising Potassium phosphate and increasing volume overload with decreasing response to diuretics and she was finally initiated on dialysis with ultrafiltration on July 12 , 1998 .
The opinion of the Renal consult was that this was permanent and non-reversible renal failure since it did not improve with dialysis and the patient will continue on dialysis three times per week .
She required approximately five liters of ultrafiltration fluid removal at each dialysis session due to her significant volume overload .
During the course of her dialysis , she had a great improvement in her lower extremity edema and her oxygen saturation .
4 ) Infectious disease :
The patient had multiple line infections during her admission including a confirmed coag. negative Staphylococcus line infection with positive blood cultures on June 23 , 1998 , July 4 , 1998 , July 8 , 1998 and July 9 , 1998 .
The patient eventually had a left subclavian Tesio catheter placed and a right brachial PICC line placed on July 10 , 1998 which remained patent and uninfected .
She received a full three week course of Vancomycin and also received a three week course of Ceftazidime .
In addition , she had a fungal urinary tract infection treated with Amphojel bladder irrigation , which was followed by a Klebsiella urinary tract infection for which she received Levofloxacin times fourteen days .
She also received a fourteen day course of Acyclovir which was begun on June 21 , 1998 for perianal lesions consistent with herpes simplex virus .
She was also on Fluconazole for some oral thrush which was inadvertently continued for a total of thirty days .
The patient was also started on Bactrim one double strength tablet q.o.d. as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while on her high dose steroids .
5 ) Rheumatology :
The patient was admitted with a question of lupus given her ANA of 1:640 although her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .
Unfortunately throughout her admission , we were unable to test any more titers since she was receiving daily plasma exchange .
A repeat ANA , rheumatoid factor and ANCA may be repeated as an outpatient .
FOLLOW-UP :
1 ) The patient will follow-up with her primary care physician , Dr. Tamarg Study , in Arvus after she is discharged from rehabilitation .
2 ) The patient is being discharged to A Hospital where she will receive onsite hemodialysis three times per week on Monday , Wednesday and Friday .
The nephrologist who will follow her there is Dr. Study .
3 ) The patient will continue to have her CBC , LDH , bilirubin , chem-7 and magnesium and calcium checked with each dialysis and the results will be faxed to Dr. Ian Zineisfreierm , the hematology attending at fax number 751-329-8840 .
4 ) The patient will eventually need a permanent dialysis fistula .
The left subclavian Tesio which she has in place will last for several months in the mean time .
She would like to arrange to have her fistula placed at Pre Health and the vascular surgeons there should be contacted regarding this .
5 ) The patient will need packed red blood cell transfusions with dialysis when her hematocrit falls below 26 .
6 ) The patient will continue her Prednisone at 40 mg p.o. q. day times one month ( this was started on July 27 , 1998 ) and then she will begin a slow taper as guided by Pulmonary .
7 ) The patient has a follow-up appointment in the Pulmonary Clinic with Dr. Cedwi Stone at 336-2931 on August 30 , 1998 at 1:40 PM .
8 ) The patient has a follow-up appointment with Dr. Ian Zineisfreierm at the We Erthunt Hospital at 180-0455 on August 15 , 1998 at 12:30 PM ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 31 year old gravida 0 with stage IV endometrial cancer and stage III-C ovarian cancer vs metastatic endometrial cancer for line 2 , cycle 1 chemotherapy .
The patient presented in 10-90 , with heavy bleeding per vagina .
D and C showed grade II-III adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation at Wellla Uxinny : mount Medical Center in Com St. , Tton , Arkansas 32167 .
The patient underwent TAH / BSO , partial omentectomy at CTMC in 10-90 .
At that time , tumor was found to be studding on the right diaphragm , gross tumor in the omentum and large bowel , tumor through the uterine serosa .
Pathology showed grade II-III papillary adenocarcinoma of the endometrium with squamous differentiation which was focally invasive and superficial myometrium .
The ovary showed papillary serous adeno with omental involvement consistent with an endometroid adenocarcinoma .
The question was whether or not whether she had two primaries vs metastatic endometrial cancer .
The patient underwent 6 cycles of CAP in Pemrancetul Tonsst ._
However _, during the fourth cycle _, Cytoxan was dropped .
Her CA-125 on 6-27-91 , was 249 and on 8-29-91 , was 734 .
In 05-92 , the patient was admitted to Wellla Uxinny : mount Medical Center with left leg DVT and started on Heparin therapy .
She was discharged from there on Coumadin therapy .
On admission , the patient has no complaints except anxiety .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient underwent chemotherapy on the following doses :
IFEX 1.2 grams per meter squared x 3 days , MESNA 1.2 grams per meter squared x 3 days continuous IV infusion .
She had VP-16 mixed with 250 cc IV fluid given over 1 hour each day for 3 days .
She also had MESNA dose of .6 grams per meter squared after her IFEX / MESNA were completed .
The patient 's urinalysis on admission was significant for red blood cells which were TNTC as well as uric acid .
Because it was felt the patient was bleeding and the patient was contaminated , she received her IFEX / MESNA .
A repeat straight cath was negative for RBC 's .
After 1 day of chemotherapy , the patient had 8-10 RBC 's in her urine but by the second day of her IFEX infusion , she had 50-80 RBC 's in her urine as well as a few transitional epithelial cells .
Because of this finding , her IFEX was stopped before completion of her second day of infusion .
Her MESNA alone was continued at that time for IV infusion .
She did receive her VP-16 without complication .
Other significant issues were the patient 's hematocrit on admission at 31.1 which dwindled down to 26.2 by 9-10 ._
The patient was counselled and received 2 units of packed RBC 's at that time  .
However , the patient 's hematocrit bumped only to 28.1 and a repeat later on 9-11 , showed hematocrit of 27.6 .
At this time , an additional 2 units of packed RBC 's were transfused .
The third issue was that her anticoagulation was grossly out of control on admission with PT of 25.6 and PTT of 42.2 .
Her repeat on 9-8 , was 36.0 / 68.2 and her Coumadin was held .
She received no Coumadin during her admission and by the time of discharge , her PT was down to 16.2 .
She was restarted on Coumadin 2.5 mg per day .
The patient 's hematocrit on the day of discharge was 35.6 showing significant bump in her count after her second two units of packed RBC 's .
Her PT on the day of discharge was 13.2 and she was started on Coumadin 2.5 mg po q d as mentioned .
The patient was discharged on 9-12-92 , with the approval of her attending physiciana , Dr. Porriede Friednantflirt .
FOLLOW UP CARE :
On 9-28-92 , the patient will return for chemotherapy and she will follow up with her primary doctor , Dr. Jescspald , for repeat PT and Coumadin dosing on Monday , 9-14-02 ."

CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 55 - year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who was referred to Dr. Brenda Hummer for discussion for surgical options to free this condition .
The patient reportedly had been experiencing increasing fatigue and dyspnea with exertion for the year prior to his admission .
The patient reported increasingly frequent episodes of dizziness and shortness of breath accompanied with coughing spells after walking approximately a half a mile or climbing three flights of stairs .
On 2010-05-27 , an echocardiogram was done which revealed critical fibrocalcific aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 125 mmHg , a mean gradient of 74 mmHg , an Oak Bluffs of 0.44 , and 1+ aortic and mitral insufficiency .
The patient subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization on 2010-06-01 , which demonstrated no hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease , but critical aortic stenosis consistent with his echocardiogram study results .
The patient was subsequently scheduled for a mechanical aortic valve replacement procedure with aortic replacement on 2010-06-07 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On 2010-06-07 , the patient underwent a mechanical aortic valve replacement with a 23 mm Carbomedics mechanical valve and a Supra coronary aortic graft with gelweave 28 mm .
The patient tolerated the procedure well with a bypass time of 155 minutes and a crossclamp time of
130 minutes , and a rest time of 16 minutes .
The patient 's pericardium was left open ; lines placed included a right radial line and a right IJ line ; both ventricular and atrial wires were placed ; two mediastinal tubes were placed .
The patient was subsequently transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit , intubated , for further evaluation and management .
On transfer , the patient 's mean arterial pressure was 76 , CVP 12 , PAD 17 , and his Bennie was 25 .
The patient was AV paced at a rate of 88 beats per minute .
Active drips included milrinone , Levophed , propofol , and insulin .
On postoperative day number one , the patient was successfully weaned and extubated without complication .
The patient was then advanced to oral intake which he tolerated without complication .
On postoperative day number two , the patient 's chest tubes were removed without complication and the patient was subsequently cleared for transfer to the floor .
The patient was subsequently admitted to the cardiothoracic service under the direction of Dr. Brenda Hummer .

10/14/96
DISCHARGE DATE :
10/27/96 date of birth ; September 30 , 1917
THER PROCEDURES :
arterial catheterization on 10/14/96 , head CT scan on 10/14/96
HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
Granrivern Call is a 79-year-old right handed white male with a history of questionable progressive supranuclear palsy , atrial fibrillation , deep venous thrombosis , and pulmonary embolus who presents with a change in mental status and a fall at home .
His family stated that he had a progressive mental decline over the past three years and was initially diagnosed with Parkinson &apos;s disease or features consistent with Parkinsonism .
This was poorly responsive to Eldopa .
He was later seen by Dr. Flo Cuchkote at the Ph University Of Medical Center and diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy .
Over the five to six weeks prior to admission he had a drop off in his mental functioning with more frequent episodes of confusion and disorientation and requiring more assistance with his activities of daily living .
He also developed a urinary incontinence .
He had had two falls to his wife &apos;s recollection , both times slipping off the edge of a chair backwards .
On the morning of admission at 8 o&apos;clock , he was noted to be moving his mouth less and speaking &quot; gibberish &quot; .
He was later sitting in a chair making multiple attempts to get up , which he subsequently did and promptly fell directly on his face at approximately 11:30 a.m.
There was no definite clonic activity .
There was no known incontinence .
He was taken to an outside hospital and nasally intubated and then transferred to the Ph University Of Medical Center Emergency Room where he was orally intubated .
A trauma evaluation was negative and thus he was transferred to the Neurology Service .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Coumadin 4 mgs po qhs , Vasotec 5 mgs po qd , Lasix prn , Digoxin 0.25 mgs poqd , Proscar and Sinemet .
ALLERGIES :
no known drug allergies .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
1) NEUROLOGY :
The patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition .
He had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the Intensive Care Unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity .
It did , however , show diffuse slowing .
He was given 1.5 grams of Dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous Ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination .
His hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the Intensive Care Unit .
He continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move .
He did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission .
His diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy .
It was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission .
It was not felt likely to be due to Parkinson &apos;s disease , as he had no significant response to Eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic .
He had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on October 18 , 1996 .
This showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy .
In addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely .
However , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage .
The etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
His electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia .
He was on intravenous TNG and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation .
He did have a slight elevation of his TPK with an additional value of 198 with a MB fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 .
That was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent CKMBs and was felt that he had a very small &quot; leaflet &quot; .
He remained chest pain free throughout his admission .
3) PULMONARY :
After his initial intubation he remained quite stable .
He was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex .
However , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission .
4) HEMATOLOGY :
He had his prothrombin time reversed with Vitamin K 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room .
His anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed .
It was decided that his goal INR was to be 2.0 .
He did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge INR was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time .
It was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems .
5) GASTROINTESTINAL :
He was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the Ph University Of Medical Center and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision .
Thus , his nasogastric tube was discontinued on October 19 , 1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well .
In discussions with the family , given his age and number of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions .
However , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure .
The family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest ."

History of Present Illness :
The patient is a 58 - year-old man with history of IDDM , PVD , status post toe amputations , diabetic neuropathy , and retinopathy recently admitted to McLean Hospital from 2017-01-13 , through 2017-01-18 , with a diagnosis of right heel diabetic ulcer with MSSA osteomyelitis of the calcaneus , MSSA bacteremia , acute interstitial nephritis secondary to oxacillin , and RLL pna .
He was sent home with a PICC line and IV antibiotics .
He returned to the Wing Memorial & Medical Center intubated from an outside hospital on 2017-02-04 , for respiratory failure and was sent to CMED CSRU .
Prior to his re-admission , his sister had noted that he was having some shaking chills and heavy breathing .
When he came back to Faulkner Hospital Hospital for confusion and diaphoresis , his initial oxygen sat was only 80% with a fingerstick of 29 .
He was given D50 , but continued to have progressive respiratory failure , was therefore intubated and transferred to the Austen Riggs Center where he was noted to have multifocal pneumonia and bacteremia with enterobacter and MSSA .
Brief Hospital Course :
1) Respiratory failure :
On admission , this was felt to be likely 03-15 worsening PNA .
Pt remained intubated until 2017-02-14 .
He had difficulty weaning from the vent due to difficulties with neurological status ( he remained drowsy and unresponsive for many days ) but eventually awoke enough and was extubated without difficulty and remained stable on 3L NC .
He was transferred to the floor but a few days later began to show signs of respiratory distress and was transferred back to the CMED CSRU for reintubation for likely aspiration event leading to worsening pneumonia as well as some component of pulm edema .
He was extubated a few days later and transferred back to the floor where his pulm status improved dramatically with lasix and continued nebulizer treatments .
The patient was prepared for discharge on 05-29 , when he was sat ' ing in the high 90 's on room air .
However , on 2017-03-01 at 6 am the pt was found with labored respirations ( rr = 24 ) and SaO2 89% , which improved to only SaO290 - 91% on 100% NRB .
ABG ( 7.42 / 38 / 88 ) was performed , 80 mg lasix was given and the patietn had foley placed and had good urine output and good mentation .
He was also given nebulizers without improvement .
His chest radiograph had fluffy bilateral infiltrates .
Although the pt was w/o fever , he had chills .
He was readmitted tot he CMED CSRU for respiratory distress likely secondary to a recurrent aspiration event .
He was continued on meropenem , started on BiPAP and aggressively suctioned in an attempt to avoid intubation .
On 03-02 at 10 am , the patient had an acutechange in mental status with bradycardia , hypertension , pinpoint pupils , decerebrate posturing and increased tone in bilateral upper extremities and unresponsiveness .
The patient was brought to CT immediately for stat scan and was found to have a massive occipital spontaneous hemorrhage into the L ventricle requiring ventricular drainage .
Neurosurgery was immediately called for an EVD and anesthesia was called STAT to the bedside for intubation at 10:45 am in order to assist in hyperventilation .
After endotracheal intubation , MAPs were maintained between 70 and 90 , dilantin was dose to maintain an appropriate level .
L frontal ICP bolt was placed by neurosurgery under sterile conditions on antibiotics .
Mannitol 75 mg iv x 1 then 50 gm iv tid was begun to maintain serum osm > 320 and Na > 147 .
The patient was hyperventilated to goal PCO2 30-35 with ICP improvement .
Serial head CT studies and neurologic exams were performed but the patient was unchaged , unresponsive with posturing and no spontaneous movement despite ICP being maintained in good range ( < 20 ).
On 2017-03-03 , a family meeting resulted in the patient 's code being changed to comfort measures only .
The patient was terminally extubated on a morphine drip and ativan titrated for agonal breathing and discomfort ; scopolamine was used as an adjunct to control secretions and appeared comfortable when he died at 12:27 pm on 2017-03-04 .
The family refused autopsy or post-mortem examination to deduce secondary causes of death .
2. ID - Bacteremia and PNA :
Pt 's triple lumen catheter was found to be growing coag neg staph . and PICC tip and sputum growing enterobacter cloacae .
The PICC was d/c 'ed and pt was continued on vancomycin ( for course of 6 weeks ) and meropenem was added on 02-09 ( for 3 week course ).
TEE was negative .
Pt finished the 3 week course of meropenem while in house and was discharged to rehab on day 34/42 of the vancomycin .
3) AIN :
Pt received oxacillin during his prior hospitalization and had AIN from this medication .
On this admission he was continued on prednisone taper .
Fluoroquinolones and other renal toxins were avoided .
Renal function gradually improved and Cr trended down from peak of 7.6 to 1.4 .
Before the patient acutely decompensated as above , the plan was for steroid taper :
60 mg x 10 days ( already completed ) , 40 mg x 14 d ( already completed ) , 20 mg x 14 d ( now day 11-24 ) , 10 mg x 10 d , 5 mg x 10 d .
4) Foot ulcer : The pt was followed by podiatry and had several further debridement of his R heel wound .
on abx , podiatry following , changed vac q3 days .
5) Encephalopathy : It was unclear why the pt 's mental status initially did not improve more quickly after all sedatives were removed and he was extubated .
His MS waxed and waned for many days and uremia vs. failure to clear sedatives were considered ( although pt was making urine and LFT 's are wnl ).
The pt had an EEG and 2 head CT 's which did not show anoxic brain injury or bleeding .
He gradually improved and was A&Ox3 and near baseline before Amesbury Hospital transferred to the CMED CSRU in respiratory distress .
6) DM :
Pt was maintained on SSI with small amount of standing insulin while he was NPO and then his dose was gradually increased as he received tube feeds .
7) FEN :
The pt had an NG tube placed and received tube feeds for the majority of his hospitalization .
Upon extubation and transfer to the floor he pulled out the NG tube time several times and required restraints .
Albumin was very low and pt had significant edema likely 03-15 this .
A few days before decompensating , his mental status improved to the degree that he was able to eat normal food without aspirating .
8) CV :
Pump / HTN : pt had episodes of both hypertension and hypotension during his stay .
He was managed with Metoprolol , Hydralazine , and Amlodipine .
Near discharge his BP was controlled with Metoprolol only .
9) Hypernatremia - While in the CMED CSRU the pt developed hypernatremia .
This was felt to be likely 03-15 intravascular volume depletion since the pt 's albumin was so low and he was third spacing all of his fluid .
He was volume resuscitated and managed with D5W and lasix as well as receving FW boluses with his NG tube feeds .
The hypernatremia fully resolved when he resumed eating on his own and had access to free water .
10) Anemia :
Pt 's Hct trended down slowly throughout his hospitalization .
Labs were consistent with anemia of chronic disease .
He was transfused 3 units pRBC 's near the end of his hospitalization and had an appropriate bump .
11) CMED CCU :
When the pt 's MS improved to near baseline before again decompensating , he became extremely tearful and expressed feelings of depression after being in the hospital for so long .
He expressed interest in taking an anti-depressant for a short time while he was recovering and was started on Celexa ."

History of Present Illness :
CC : dyspnea
HPI :
86 yo man with h/o CVA , CHF , recent episodes of aspiration pneumonia , who p/w dyspnea from his NH .
Per the pt 's daughter , the patient has had 2-3 episodes of asp pna in the last 2 months , for which he has received IV abx at the NH with apparent resolution of symptoms .
The daughter says that on the day PTA , when she visited the patient at the NH , he was "" having a good day ,"" more interactive than usual and in good spirits .
She was called at 430 am today from the NH with the news that the pt was not doing well , and she came to the Deanna to meet up with her father .
Of note , the patient 's daughter and son-in-law confirm his desire to be DNR/DNI , stating that they want him to be comfortable .
However , when asked if she thinks he would want comfort measures even if it meant that his respiratory status would worsen , the pt 's daughter says that he would not .
In particular , she feels that the pt would not want a morphine drip if it would negatively impact his respiratory function .
ROS : patient unable to communicate at current time
Brief Hospital Course :
This 86 yo man with h/o CVA , CHF , recent episodes of aspiration pneumonia , presented with dyspnea from his NH , likely from new RLL pneumonia .
He was started on Zosyn and Vanco for his presumed aspiration , ' hospital ' aquired PNA .
PE was considered but less likely given his fevers and clear pneumonia on CXR .
He was supported on BIPAP for his respiratory status .
An ABG was attempted in the Deanna however it was limited by pt discomfort .
ABG on arrival to the ICU was 7.29/56/75 .
He was continued on BIPAP .
Blood cultures and sputum cultures were sent .
Over the course of the day he continued to decline .
He was given some prn Morphine for comfort .
In the evening of the day of admission he was noted to be increasingly somnolent .
A repeat ABG was performed which was 7.03/129/148 .
His family was notified that he was doing worse and came in to visit him .
It was his family 's wish that he be made comfortable .
Based upon this wish the BIPAP was removed and he was placed on nasal cannula .
He was written for a morphine drip however he expired before this could be initiated .
Secondary issues
Elevated lactate :
This was concerning for early sepsis given RLL PNA .
His blood pressures remained elevated and he was hydrated with NS conservatively , given h/o CHF and dyspnea .
DM2 :
He was covered with a Insulin drip while unstable

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 64-year-old female with a history of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus , and dilated cardiomyopathy ( with a transthoracic echocardiogram in 2016-01-13 showing an ejection fraction of 40% , posterior and inferior apical akinesis , and large left ventricular thrombus ).
The patient was admitted from 2016-01-21 to 2016-02-03 ; at which time she was ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
She had a cardiac catheterization which revealed 3-vessel disease with normal left main , mid left anterior descending artery 60% , diffuse 90% mid distal stenosis at the origin of the diagonal , serial 70% and 90% left circumflex lesions , and 90% first obtuse marginal , and mid right coronary artery 60% .
During initial evaluation for a coronary artery bypass graft , 80% to 90% of the right coronary artery stenosis was found ; for which she underwent a right internal carotid artery stent .
She was discharged on Coumadin for a goal INR of 2.5 to 3 .
She was then admitted again on 2016-03-30 for an elective coronary artery bypass graft .
At surgery , the descending aorta was noted to be calcified , and an intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram revealed an irregular intra-aortic pedunculated lesion .
Given the elevated stroke risk of aortic cross-clamping in the setting of this finding , the plan for a bypass graft was aborted .
The patient was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit Service for medical management in anticipation of possible percutaneous coronary intervention later in the admission .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a 64-year-old female with 3-vessel disease who was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit Service for Western Mass . Hospital medical optimization and management following an aborted coronary artery bypass graft when a mobile aortic atheroma was noted .
The patient was continued on aspirin , Plavix , and statin .
Once the patient was titrated off dopamine , the beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were restarted .
With regard to the left ventricular thrombus , her goal INR remained 2.5 to 3 ; and the goal was to start heparin once the patient was stable from a thoracotomy and chest tube
standpoint .
The patient remained comfortable .
By 04-01 , on postoperative day two , the patient was doing well and the chest tube was discontinued .
The patient still had transcutaneous pacing wires in place .
Likewise , on 04-01 , the patient was weaned off surgery without difficulty .
Thus , the beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were started to be titrated up .
In addition , the patient was started on Wellbutrin for smoking cessation .
At this point , it was determined that the patient would not receive percutaneous coronary intervention on this admission and would likely be discharged to the floor for stabilization with followup .
The patient did well and was transferred to the floor on 04-02 .
After evaluation and a discussion with Dr. Gunter , it was determined that the patient no longer needed anticoagulation since there was no aortic thrombus but only an aortic plaque , and there was no anterior/apical akinesis noted .
At this point , the left ventricular thrombus ( for which she was initially started therapy for ) was no longer present .
The patient was noted to have a slight hematocrit drop and was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells for a goal hematocrit of greater than 30 .
By 04-03 , captopril and atenolol were started , and the patient 's leg bandage from the vein harvest was removed .
The patient continued to do well on the medical regimen and was without chest pain , shortness of breath , or any other symptoms ."

She has had continuing vaginal discharge , and was diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis one day prior to admission , and was given a prescription for Flagyl .
She noted increasing abdominal pain two days prior to admission , which became more severe on the day prior to admission .
She went to her primary care physician 's office on the day of admission complaining of abdominal pain , which she stated was constant but intermittently sharper at times .
The location was variable .
She also complained of some loose stools on the day of admission , no nausea or vomiting .
Her temperature was 100.4 in the office , and she had no chills .
She was sent for a CT scan of her abdomen , which revealed fluid and question of gas in the endometrial cavity , and she was sent to Pinewood , Norfolk for treatment and admission .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and was initially started on intravenous ampicillin , gentamicin and clindamycin .
Her initial white blood cell count was 11.3 , with a normal differential .
Her sedimentation rate was elevated at 110 .
Her electrolytes were within normal limits .
She was maintained on intravenous antibiotics .
On hospital day number three , her blood cultures came back positive in the anaerobic culture for gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters .
Further identification revealed staphylococcus coag-negative , which was sensitive to gentamicin and clindamycin .
She was continued on her antibiotics , and was afebrile until hospital day number five , when she had a temperature spike to 102.3 .
Repeat blood cultures were sent .
Her white blood cell count was 12.8 , with a normal differential .
At this time , an Infectious Disease consult was obtained , and the recommendation was to discontinue the ampicillin , gentamicin and clindamycin , and start her on intravenous Unasyn .
She underwent a pelvic ultrasound and an abdomen and pelvis CT , which revealed continued air in the endometrial cavity vs. in the fundal fibroid .
Discussion was had at this time with the patient regarding whether or not this represented an infected abscess vs. post-surgical change .
Extensive discussion was held , and second opinion was obtained regarding the need for
possible drainage of the abscess vs. hysterectomy .
The patient requested an outside second opinion , as she was reluctant to undergo hysterectomy at this time .
She was discharged to home on hospital day number eight , on oral antibiotics .
The patient was to have a repeat CT scan in one week .
She was also to obtain a second opinion regarding the question of possible surgical management ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is the second Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital admission for Taroby Patient , a 70 year old male with a history of metastatic melanoma .
His melanoma was originally diagnosed last fall when he presented with lesions in the liver and spleen , and a chest CT showed left upper lobe nodules .
A head CT scan was negative , but an MRI scan of the spine showed an L5 metastasis with a fracture and had with epidural and paraspinal extension .
In addition , there was a T11 metastasis with cord compression .
Approximately one week ago , he was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for chemotherapy with DTIC and Tamoxifen .
At that time , he also began radiation therapy to his lumbosacral spine .
He is continuing on the radiation therapy to date .
On February 23 , Mr. Patient presented to Dr. Patient &apos;s office with two major symptoms .
First , he had right lower extremity swelling and lower extremity noninvasives confirmed the diagnosis of a femoral deep venous thrombosis .
Second , he had a witnessed episode in which his eyes rolled to the back of his head and there was a question of some seizure activity .
In the past , he has not been known to have a history of CNS metastases .
The episode of potential seizure activity occurred in the setting of a bowel movement and may have been associated with vasovagal activity .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. Patient underwent venogram and inferior vena cava filter placement on February 23 , 1993 and was then he was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for postoperative care .
He tolerated the procedure well .
In addition , the second major event that had occurred yesterday was a neurologic event of some kind .

As above , and once transferred to the floor , patient had fingersticks monitored every four hours with a sliding scale .
Patient reached goal of fingersticks between 50 and 300 , which is what she maintains at home .
Sliding scale was adjusted as necessary .
Patient was continued on intravenous fluids until taking good po .
Infectious Disease :
The patient had an elevated white count upon admission , however , white count came down to 7.1 and prior to discharge , patient was afebrile and no clear etiology for elevated white blood cell on admission , questionably secondary to short gastrointestinal infection , however , patient is completely symptom free upon discharge .
Fluid , electrolytes and nutrition :
The patient 's electrolytes were repleted as necessary .
Potassium was given with her intravenous fluids and phosphate will be repleted as patient increases her po intake ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 68-year-old patient of Dr. Naka Jesc had two episodes of rheumatic fever as a teenager .
She has had chronic atrial fibrillation .
Coumadin has caused bleeding from the mouth and nose on two occasions , on one occasion with prothrombin time 13 , and has been replaced by anti-platelet agents .
She has had recurrent syncope since age 6 .
She has now had progressive heart failure .
A Holter showed atrial fibrillation with period of ventricular bigemini .
She cut down dramatically on smoking two years ago , but has continued to smoke , although , very recently , she admits to only &quot; two puffs &quot; per day .
She has not had hypertension or diabetes , and says he has lowered her cholesterol from 333 to 197 by changing her diet .
There is no family history of heart disease .
She has been treated with Vanceril for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
She has had one gram per day proteinuria with normal creatinine .
She had a partial gastrectomy in 1972 for a &quot; tumor &quot; .
She has had an appendectomy and cholecystectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Digoxin 0.125 mg po q.d. , Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , aspirin held , and Vanceril three puffs b.i.d.
ALLERGIES :
Transdermal nitroglycerin caused headache .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She does not drink .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Cardiac catheterization was performed without complication from the right neck and right groin on the day of admission .
Right atrial pressure was 12 with a wave form consistent with tricuspid regurgitation .
There was no tricuspid valve gradient .
Pulmonary artery pressure was markedly elevated at 120/60 .
Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was markedly elevated at 38 , with a very large mitral valve gradient .
There was little or no aortic valve gradient .
Fich cardiac output was 3.0 and indexed 2.0 .
Arterial oxygen saturation was 85 percent .
There was minimal mitral valve calcification , normal left ventricular contraction , and 2+ mitral regurgitation into a large left atrium .
There was minimal aortic valve calcification , mild ______________ thickening , normal open , and mild aortic regurgitation .
There was mild atherosclerosis of the mid left anterior descending .
FVC was 1.6 or 58 percent of predicted and FEV1 0.95 or 45 percent of predicted .
Room air arterial blood gas was 56/40/7.45 .
Because it would be ideal to place a mechanical valve if valve replacement rather that commissurotomy is needed , she was seen by Dr. Ca Shuff of ENT for her history of epistaxis .
He identified no bleeding source , but felt that the risk of nasal hemorrhage on Coumadin could be minimized interventional neuroradiology occlusion of the arteries to the nose bilaterally .
The patient was therefore referred to the Dr. A Eu Wave .
The procedure could not be scheduled during this admission .
The patient is , therefore , discharged after a three day hospitalization , with plans for re-admission for the neuroradiology procedure .
This will be followed by a trial of Coumadin , and then by mitral commissurotomy or replacement and probable tricuspid annuloplasty by Dr. Riemund C. Wave .
In the meantime , Lasix dosage is increased .
Potassium replacement has caused , according to the patient , marked hyperkalemia in the past ."

HISTORY :
Baby Barbara Stead is a term infant admitted with increasing head circumference and bruising .
He was born to a 31-year-old G1 P0 now 1 mother with unremarkable prenatal screens as follows :
O positive , antibody negative , hepatitis B surface antigen negative , RPR nonreactive , rubella immune
PREGNANCY HISTORY :
Estimated date of delivery was 2012-05-14 for estimated gestational age of 39-1/7 weeks .
Pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios with an AFI of 3.5 and by multiple evaluations for decreased fetal movement .
There was spontaneous onset of labor progressing through vacuum assisted vaginal delivery under epidural anesthesia .
clear amniotic fluid , no antepartum maternal fever or fetal tachycardia , no antepartum antibiotic prophylaxis .
Baby was vigorous at delivery , was bulb suction , dried , and had free flow oxygen administered briefly .
Apgars were nine and nine .
In the Newborn Nursery , he initially had a caput which increased in the amount of swelling and bruising in the subsequent 24 hours .
He was then referred to the CMED CCU for assessment and management of the increased bleeding .
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS :
1. Respiratory :
Patient has been on room air maintaining sats above 95% .
No apnea or bradycardia .
2. Cardiovascular :
There was an initial murmur on admission likely secondary to severe anemia which has since resolved .
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout this admission .
3. FEN :
Patient was restarted on po feeds as of day of life three after the bleeding had stabilized .
He has been taking breast milk or Enfamil 20 po adlib .
His admission weight was 3850 grams .
His weight on discharge was 4055 .
4. GI :
Given the significant amount of bleeding , baby was started prophylactically on phototherapy .
His bilirubin peaked on day of life three at 5.4 with a subsequent bilirubin of 4.6 at which time phototherapy was discontinued .
5. Hematology :
Given the rapid extension of the subgaleal bleed , coagulopathy workup was initiated revealing an elevated PTT level of 77 as well as factor 8 level that was below detection in the presence of normal factors 5 , 9 , 10 , and 11 .
He was started on a 50 units / kg bolus of factor 8 followed by continuous factor 8 infusions at 50 units / kg / day divided until hourly infusion rates at 05-10 .
Subsequent factor 8 levels varied with an initial factor 8 level of 18 after the bolus with which he received another bolus of factor 8 of 50 units / kg and increased factor 8 infusion rate to 65 units / kg / day .
As of 05-17 , he was switched over to bolus infusion in preparation of continued home factor 8 administration .
His peak level after a bolus of 75 units / kg of factor 8 was 131 .
A trough level at 20 hours after the bolus on day of discharge was 29 .
He will continue to receive factor 8 bolus q day for a total of 2-3 weeks in light of the intracranial hemorrhage , and will be followed by Hematology visiting nurse Michael Edwards level checks at home .
Currently , the infusion of factor 8 are going through a jugular Broviac which was placed on 05-15 for administration of factor .
His last PTT on 05-16 was 68.3 .
The last hematocrit was on 05-16 of 54.5 .
6. Neurology :
Baby Mary Stead initially presented with significant subgaleal bleed as well as a small subdural hemorrhage .
A repeat head CT scan on 05-15 had shown the resolution of the subdural hematoma and significant improvement of the subgaleal bleed .
His head ultrasound on 05-14 reveals no interventricular hemorrhage .
He had remained neurologically stable .
His head circumference on 05-18 was 36.5 cm with a maximum head circumference on
admission of 40.5 cm .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 52 - year-old female with no known cardiopulmonary history who presented with a chief complaint of dyspnea on exertion as well as exertional chest tightness which was acute-on-chronic .
The patient stated her symptoms began in 2011 and have increased in intensity and frequency every since then .
She reports dyspnea on exertion and chest tightness daily which worsened significantly one day prior to admission .
Says that she could not walk a few yards without developing symptoms .
She describes the chest tightness as substernal and epigastric .
She denied any associated nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , lightheadedness , or dizziness .
She does have radiation of the pain to her neck and jaw bilaterally .
She also describes a fast heart rate and palpitations .
She stated her symptoms improved with rest , and she denied any symptoms beginning when she was at rest .
The patient reports a previous workup which included a negative exercise treadmill test , a normal MIBI in 2011-04-10 , and a normal echocardiogram in 2012 ( except some borderline mild pulmonary hypertension ) with an ejection fraction of 55% .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Review of systems was significant for menopausal symptoms ( for which she has attempted hormone replacement therapy , discontinued in 2014 ).
She also reports difficulty sleeping , daytime sleepiness .
She sleeps on elevated pillows secondary to her gastroesophageal reflux disease .
Occasional paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea in the past but none recently .
Occasional lower extremity edema , left greater than right .
No abdominal or urinary complaints .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a 52 - year-old female with no known history of cardiac disease presenting with dyspnea on exertion and chest tightness , who was admitted for evaluation and management of her symptoms .
1. CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient was admitted for complaints of dyspnea on exertion and chest pressure which could be consistent with angina .
However , given the long duration of the symptoms and negative workup in the past , it was thought to be unlikely .
However , the patient was started on an aspirin as well as a beta blocker , and a rule out myocardial infarction protocol was initiated .
A stress thallium was planned for the day following admission .
However , on the night of admission the patient was found lying in her bed diaphoretic and obtunded , and a code was called .
Further examination revealed a strong palpable pulse with a systolic blood pressure in the 130 s and a heart rate in the 80 s.
Over the course of the next few minutes the patient became increasingly more responsive .
She was treated with a fluid bolus .
The patient quickly responded to a fluid bolus and became interactive .
She reported that she was sitting on the commode urinating and began to feel nauseous and presyncopal .
She was able to get to bed at which point she passed out .
She denied any chest pain or pressure , and no shortness of breath during this event .
A rhythm check obtained during the time of this event demonstrated a pause of six seconds followed by a junctional escape rhythm .
An electrocardiogram obtained after the code demonstrated no acute changes .
Her acute bradycardic event was felt likely secondary to her new beta blocker in conjunction with a vagal response .
It was determined to stop the beta blocker , and atropine was placed at the bedside .
On the following day the patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated dilated right ventricle secondary to chronic dysfunction and a pulmonary artery pressure of greater than 100 .
Her stress test was cancelled .
A CT angiogram was ordered to evaluate for chronic thromboembolic disease as a potential cause of her pulmonary hypertension .
She was ruled out for myocardial infarction with three sets of normal enzymes and continued to be monitored on telemetry .
A Pulmonary consultation was obtained to evaluate for possible etiology of the patient 's hypotension .
There was little evidence to suggest any cardiac disease , and given the patient 's Grave's disease an autoimmune process was felt to be possible .
In addition , consideration was given to sarcoidosis , human immunodeficiency virus , and drug-induced given her history of herbal medication use .
It was recommended that the patient begin anticoagulation given the severity of her pulmonary hypertension .
It was also planned to undergo a right heart catheterization with a vasodilation trial by the catheterization laboratory .
A right heart catheterization was performed on 2014-12-05 .
A pharmacologic pulmonary vasodilator challenge was performed with a positive response .
In addition , a CT angiogram of the chest with pulmonary embolism protocol showed no intravascular filling defect but did show a right upper lobe ground-glass and scattered adenopathy .
Therefore , in the end left atrial hypertension was essentially ruled out as a primary cause .
Chronic pulmonary embolus was less likely given her negative CT angiogram .
Chronic lung disease was unlikely given the patient 's normal pulmonary function tests and DLCO in 2012 as well as a normal CT angiogram .
Collagen vascular disease could not be definitively ruled out ; however , given the patient 's lack of connective tissue disorder stigmata it was thought to be less likely , and the patient 's human immunodeficiency virus test was negative .
Therefore , it was felt that the patient was most likely experiencing a primary pulmonary hypertension .
Consideration was given to treating the patient with a course of calcium channel blocker ; however , given the patient 's poor response to Lopressor , it was determined that this would not be optimal treatment for the patient 's pulmonary hypertension .
Therefore , her insurance company was contacted regarding the potential of Flolan as a treatment .
Plans were made for placement of a Hickman catheter and initiation of Flolan treatment .
However , on 12-07 , the patient once again experienced an episode of unresponsiveness .
Upon arrival by the physician the patient was awake , alert , and oriented with a pulse in the 80 s, with pressure in the 80 s, and satting 100% on room air .
She described this episode as an uncomfortable feeling in her chest .
The patient was treated with 2 liters of intravenous fluids with a bump in her systolic blood pressure to the 90 s.
Review of telemetry revealed an 8 to 9 beat episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia followed by an episode of bradycardia to 60 beats per minute .
The etiology of these cardiovascular episodes was unclear , but was felt likely secondary to the patient 's tenuous cardiovascular status given the fact that she had clear pulmonary hypertension , was very preload dependent , and had an intact left ventricular function but with cardiac output limited due to left ventricular compression by a dilated left ventricle .
Given the patient 's persistent hypotensive episodes , and decreased urine output , she was transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management prior to initiation of Flolan therapy .
On 12-08 , the Hickman catheter was placed in preparation of Flolan administration .
During the Mass. Mental Health Center Medical Intensive Care Unit stay , the patient was found to exquisitely preload dependent and responded well to aggressive fluids as needed to maintain her blood pressure with a systolic of greater than 90 .
She had no further episodes of bradycardia during her Medical Intensive Care Unit stay .
In addition , the patient 's urine output improved dramatically with hydration therapy , suggesting her low urine output was secondary to decreased cardiac output secondary to low preload .
The patient continued to be followed by the Electrophysiology Service , who determined that the patient was demonstrating severe vasal sensitivity with bradycardia necessitating pacemaker placement .
This was to be deferred until after the patient had her Hickman in place .
Because the patient 's pulmonary pressures responded so well to adenosine during right heart catheterization , it was thought that the patient would be a good candidate for Flolan therapy .
Flolan was initiated on 12-08 at 5 nanograms per kilogram per minute .
The patient was monitored for symptoms of Flolan therapy including nausea , vomiting , first bite jaw claudication , or hypotension .
Over the course of the hospital stay the patient 's Flolan dose was titrated to receive maximum benefit without precipitating symptoms of Flolan overdose .
The patient was felt to be stable on her current Flolan dose and was therefore transferred back to the floor .
A high resolution CT was requested to further evaluate for possible secondary cause of her primary pulmonary hypertension ; however , the patient refused it at this time .
Plans for placement of a pacemaker were initiated .
However , on the night prior to the planned surgical date the patient suffered an episode of bleeding from her Hickman catheter site .
Surgery was notified and pressure was applied ; however , it did not stop oozing .
A surgicel dressing was placed and prolonged pressure resulted in resolution of the bleeding .
In addition , an extra stitch was placed in an effort to stop the bleeding .
Following this episode the patient felt like she was "" too stressed "" for pacemaker placement .
Therefore , she was monitored over the next few days for any further bleeding events .
Over the course of the next few days the patient became more accustomed to her Flolan , and Flolan teaching was continued .
She continued to have occasional episodes of dizziness , shortness of breath , and hypotension whenever the alarm sounded suggesting that the Flolan bag needed to be changed .
However , over the course of the hospital stay these decreased both in frequency and severity .
On 12-15 , the patient went for placement of a pacemaker .
She had dual-mode , dual-pacing , dual-sensing pacemaker placed with a lower rate at 60 ppm , and upper rate of 120 ppm with a paced AV of 150 msec .
The patient recovered well from her surgery for pacemaker placement .
At the time of discharge , the patient was tolerating her Flolan therapy well .
She had received a full course of Flolan teaching and reported that she and her husband felt comfortable with the administration of the medication at home .
She was set up with a primary pulmonary hypertension support group , and home services were arranged to help her in the initiation of Flolan therapy .
Following pacemaker placement the patient had no further episodes of bradycardia on telemetry , and therefore she was discharged in satisfactory condition .
2. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient had no signs or symptoms of infection at the time of admission .
However , she was noted to have a relatively elevated white blood cell count that remained stable over the course of her hospital stay .
However , near the end of her hospitalization the patient began describing increased urinary frequency which persisted once her Foley catheter was removed .
A urinalysis was positive and urine culture grew enterococcus which was pan sensitive .
Therefore , the patient was started on levofloxacin therapy to complete a 10 - day course .
Following initiation of the antibiotic the patient 's white blood cell count quickly came down , and she remained afebrile .
At the time of discharge , the patient still had a mildly elevated white blood cell count but was asymptomatic with a normal temperature .
She will complete two more days of Levaquin therapy as an outpatient .
3. RENAL :
The patient 's BUN and creatinine were followed over the course of her hospital stay .
These remained stable and within normal limits .
It was felt that the decreased urine output was secondary to her preload dependence , and that her urine output increased significantly when she was adequately hydrated in the Medical Intensive Care Unit .
4. GASTROINTESTINAL :
The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease .
She was continued on Protonix over the course of her hospital stay and had no further gastrointestinal issues .
5. HEMATOLOGY :
The patient 's hematocrit remained stable over the course of her hospital stay .
Despite bleeding from the Hickman site , she did not require any transfusion therapy .
6. FLUIDS / ELECTROLYTES / NUTRITION :
The patient tolerated a regular diet throughout the course of her hospital stay .
Her electrolytes were checked on a daily basis and remained within normal limits , being replaced as needed .
She was discharged to home on a regular diet .
7. ENDOCRINE :
The patient with a history of hypothyroidism .
She was continued on her regular Synthroid dose .
She will need a TSH and T4 checked as an outpatient .
8. CODE STATUS :
The patient is a full code .
9. FLOLAN ADMINISTRATION :
At the time of discharge , the patient was tolerating a Flolan dose of 5 nanograms per kilogram per minute .
A Physical Therapy consultation was obtained to initiate a 6 - minute walk test .
On room air , the patient 's oxygen saturation was 95% and dropped to 88% following a 6 - minute walk .
The patient was discharged to home with appropriate Flolan teaching and supplies .
She was to follow up with Dr. Savage in the Clinic the following week ."

NEUROLOGY
History of Present Illness :
Ms. Swanson is a 53 yo woman with PMH significant for seizure disorder , brain injury , and ? atypical multiple sclerosis who presents with right face twitch and right arm shaking .
History is obtained from her sister , William from Lawrence General Hospital , and from her primary neurologist , Dr. Brian .
She lives in an assisted living , and was noted yesterday to have generalized tonic-clonic activity beginning on the right side and lasting 90 minutes .
EMS gave her valium 5 mg pr at the facility and brought her to Barnstable County Hospital .
She persisted with right sided seizure activity there and was given valium 10 mg and ativan 1 mg , as well as loaded with dilantin 1000 mg .
She was transferred to the Providence Behavioral Health Hospital CMED .
Here she was given an additional valium 5 mg x 2 and ativan 1 mg x 3 for persistent twitching in her face and right hand .
Since the ativan , her facial twitching has apparently improved , but she continues to have hand twitches .
She also had an EEG , which showed left sided slowing on preliminary read .
Apparently she has a long history of seizure disorder , possibly from a history of traumatic brain injury ( though per Dr. Paula , 
records from that hospitalization indicate she may have only had a very mild injury ) and has been managed on dilantin and keppra .
Since she has seen Dr. Ollie , she has had at least two episodes of status epilepticus and one generalized seizure , as well as some less significant seizures which are characterized by left gaze preference and left sided tonic-clonic activity .
Her dilantin levels had been somewhat difficult to control .
He tried adding lamictal , but this caused a rash .
At the time of her last visit ( 2015-03-18 ) Dr. Bradley had discussed the addition of a third Castelluccio , possibly zonegran ( less likely topamax ), to the dilantin 200 mg bid and keppra 1500 mg bid .
Her sister had wanted to keep the current course because she felt she was doing well where she was living and did not want to upset that .
However , she had several dilantin levels drawn since her last visit , with 15.4 in 05 - 23.5 in Theresa , and 3.09 - 18 .
Her sister reports that the medication dose had been changed to 200 mg qam and 100 mg qpm in Theresa , and a review of her Union Hospital - North Shore Medical Center records indicates that this may have occurred in an urgent care appointment secondary to slurred speech and a recent fall and a non-trough level of 15.9 .
According to her sister , the patient has no short-term memory .
She has been living in an assisted living facility and frequently calls her even right after she has left without remembering her visit .
The patient walks with a walker at baseline and goes out for dinner and shopping with her sister .
Ms. Swanson also carries a diagnosis of "" atypical MS "", which she brought with her to Dr. Billie .
According to Dr. Nicole , she has had stable deficits for many years without any flare-like episodes .
She had an MRI in 2014 that showed multiple plaque-like lesions , but these were entirely stable since 2010 .
She is not undergoing any treatment .
Reportedly she has been evaluated at Shriner's Hospital for Crippled Children , HealthSouth Braintree Rehab Hospital , and possibly St. Elizabeth's Medical Center of Boston .
She has not had an LP as far as Dr. Ginger knows .
Brief Hospital Course :
53 yo woman with h/o seizure disorder , demyelinating disease , and brain injury , presents with prolonged seizure , now unresponsive with persistent twitching of right arm and face .
This is most consistent with complex partial seizures with a focus in the left hemisphere , most likely the motor strip .
In the past , her seizures were on the left side , which implies that she now has a new focus .
It is possible that this is secondary to her underlying demyelinating disease , but per report this has not been very active .
Other possibilities include infection , including her UTI .
It is likely that these seizures began due to subtherapeutic dilantin levels on her new dose of 200 mg / 100 mg .
Her seizure management is difficult , given the higher doses were causing her to fall and slur her speech .
Discussed with Dr. Joaquin the addition of an alternate Castelluccio with the possibility of tapering down the dilantin in the future , and he agreed that she may benefit from zonegran .
Cannot use lamictal or depakote due to reactions .
Topamax is another possibility , but not ideal in a patient with preexisting cognitive deficits .
She was started on zonegran at 50 mg daily with plans to increase by 50 mg every other week to a goal dose of 200 mg / day ; she was on 100 mg daily at discharge and should have her dose increased on 10-12 and again on 10-26 .
She was continued on keppra and dilantin with trough checked frequently and adjustment as needed .
Ativan was used for breakthrough seizures ( facial twitching ).
MRI/MRA showed new temporal lesions , but it is unclear if these are the cause or effect of her seizures .
She will need to have a repeat MRI in several months for further evaluation .
LP was done and had no changes to suggest a different etiology ( ie negative cytology and negative immunophenotyping ).
Oligoclonal bands were not assessed as there was not enough CSF per the laboratory .
She will need repeated dilantin troughs with one time dose when trough is subtherapeutic .
Pending tests :
ANGIOTENSIN 1 CONVERTING ENZYME
EBV-PCR
HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS PCR
Ernest VIRUS ( JCV ) DNA PCR
LYME , TOTAL EIA WITH REFLEX TO CSF RATIO
VARICELLA DNA ( PCR )
VDRL
2. atypical MS : discussed with her outpt neurologist ( Dr. Ford in Boston Medical Center ); no current role for MS medications .
MRI was performed and showed new lesions vs sz effects in the left temporal lobe .
She also had a new lesion on her last MRI in the centrum semiovale .
LP was done to evaluate for malignancy , and no malignant cells were seen .
Immunotyping was negative as well ( per verbal report ).
Unfortunately , oligoclonal bands could not be sent from the CSF ( lab sent CSF for other studies and there was not enough left over for OCB s).
This was relayed to the family ( Kirk ).
Given that she does have new lesions on MRI , if OCB s were sent this would have weighed in in her dx of MS , and it's possible she could benefit from MS therapy .
This was relayed to the family , and they will readdress this with Dr. Ford ( MS Hoyos ).
The family is confident in any decision Dr. Ford would make re : therapy for her MS .
3. fevers on admission : Pt w/ positive U/A , treated with bactrim x 3 days with defervescence .
4. depression : continue escitalopram ; assess need to change medication as an outpatient .
5. FEN : NGT was placed given her altered mental status , and she has been unable to pass a swallow evaluation , but has improved .
This should be repeated in several days as her mental status continues to clear .

MEDICINE
History of Present Illness :
This is an 83 y/o female with moderate AS , s/p MVR 27 years ago , s/p PPM , DM , CHF , p/w dsypnea and increased work of breathing x 4-5 days .
Per family , the patient has had worsening CHF/volume overload over the last several weeks , requiring supplemental O2 at rehab .
Over the last few days , she has been noted to be more short of breath and having sats to 60% on RA .
Her lasix was increased to 60 mg bid .
Beginning today , she was noted to be in hypoxic respiratory distress , 87-91% on 2L/NC .
She was increased to 5L , with her sats going up to 97% .
She was also noted to be more confused over the last few days and especially today .
She was given lasix and 2 mg IV morphine at New England Sinai Hospital & Rehab Center Rehab , and sent to Nantucket Cottage Hospital for further evaluation .
En route , she was given additional lasix of 60 mg IV and nitro spray x 2 .
In the Deanna , her VS were Tc 97.2 , BP 146/25 , HR 70 , RR 27 , SaO2 95%/NRB .
Foley was placed in Deanna .
She was given 40 mg IV lasix and 325 mg ASA .
She was placed on BiPAP for comfort at 30% FiO2 , 5 PEEP , 12 PS .
Admitted to the CMED CSRU for further management .
Per family , besides the dyspnea and SOB , the patient has had no other symptoms , including f/c/s , CP , palpitations , abd pain , n/v/diarrhea .
She has had decreased appetite over the last few days in the context of increasing confusion .
Brief Hospital Course :
A/P - 83yo F with valvular disorder , AF , and h/o CAD a/w hypercarbic respiratory failure .
# Respiratory failure - She was admitted to the CMED CSRU for her repiratory failure which was thought to be secondary to CHF .
Pt was diuresed with iv lasix / acetazolamide and given iv morphine / prn for respiratory distress and BIPAP was tried .
However , hypercarbia ( 04-11 metabolic alkalosis ) remained in the 90s .
Pt was mentating okay , having conversations with intermittent somnolence despite hypercarbia .
TTE showed preserved EF with moderate AS and moderate MS and mod pulm HTN .
Cardiology was consulted and thought MS Harold Holcomb to her pulm edema and pulm HTN .
Cardiology recommended d/cing digoxin and starting amiodarone .
Family declined valvuloplasty .
For possible COPD , pt was started on steroids and nebs on 08-03 .
Pt is currently satting 90s on 1 L NC while sitting in a chair but needs more O2 when supine .
Pt is a mouth breather and occasionally needs a face mask .
Pt will need I/Os monitored to goal even to slightly negative as she was diursed 4.8 L during her CMED stay .
Depending on her I/O , lasix and acetazolamide can be decreased or discontinued .
If she were to decompensate at the rehab , goals of care will need to be readdressed .
# h/o CAD - There were new changes on EKG but pt was ruled out with 3 sets of negative cardiac enzymes .
Pt was continued on BB , ASA , and nitrates .
# Acid / base status - Respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation .
Appears to be chronic in nature given degree of metabolic compensation with acute component earlier today .

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mrs. Gonzalez is a patient with a prior medical history including hypothyroidism , iron-deficiency anemia , osteoporosis , increased cholesterol , peptic ulcer disease , chronic constipation , and status post appendectomy as well as status post hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy .
She was transferred from an outside hospital for evaluation and treatment of adenocarcinoma involving the transverse colon and gallbladder .
At the outside hospital the patient had already seemed some workup for a couple weeks duration of bilateral upper quadrant pain which occasionally radiated to her back .
She was also complaining of fatigue for two weeks but a good appetite and the patient denied weight loss , melena , or bright red blood per rectum .
A CAT scan of the abdomen showed air-fluid levels in the gallbladder .
It also showed a thickened gallbladder wall as well as a dilated common bile duct .
Incidentally , it also showed diverticulosis .
A HIDA scan at the other hospital did not show filling of the gallbladder indicating some sort of
cystic duct obstruction .
The first imaging study that was done at Hahnemann General Hospital was a MRCP which revealed an enhanced thickened gallbladder wall consistent with chronic cholecystitis .
A differential according to the imaging included a fistula with adjacent inflammatory change but also carcinoma or adenomatosis .
In addition, also the MRCP showed a mass near the region of the neck of the gallbladder .
Of note , at the outside hospital , an endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed .
The colonoscopy showed two polyps and also a region in the transverse colon that was biopsied .
This biopsy came back as positive for adenocarcinoma .
The diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was already established prior to her admission at this hospital .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was scheduled for an operative date on 2014-07-29 and over the next few days she was
given a low-residual diet .
She had her belly cleaned with Hibiclens one a day and once an adequate preoperative evaluation was performed , she was given a bowel prep on Monday afternoon and evening in preparation for an exploratory laparotomy on Tuesday , 2014-07-29 .
On the morning of 2014-07-29 , the patient was taken to the Operating Room and underwent a cholecystectomy , partial hepatectomy , partial lymph node dissection , a colocolostomy , partial colectomy , and in addition a gastrostomy and a feeding jejunostomy were also put in place .
Please refer to the previously dictated operative notes for the details of this surgery .
Briefly , the surgery on 2014-07-29 revealed a carcinoma of the gallbladder with a cholecystocolonic fistula which crossed into the liver as well as metastatic adenopathy around the portal nodes as well as retroperitoneal nodes around the inferior vena cava and the hepatic artery .
In addition to the gastrostomy and feeding jejunostomy tube , two Belmont-Gardner drains were placed .
The patient 's pain postoperatively was controlled with an epidural catheter .
However , the epidural had the consequence of causing a bit of a hypotension in the patient and the patient was admitted to the Surgical ICU for the first postoperative day .
In addition , the patient had low hematocrits which required a transfusion of packed red blood cells .
In addition , on postoperative day number two , the patient was transferred out to the floor and she was doing better in terms of pain control on a Dilaudid PCA machine .
On postoperative day number two , interestingly , the patient was complaining of sensitivity to light from an unknown etiology .
The patient 's postoperative course was unremarkable aside from the photophobia .
On postoperative day number two , an Oncology consult with Dr. Natalie Mcalister was obtained and
follow-up appointments were scheduled with him as an outpatient .
Following that , the patient was slowly advanced to clear liquids and to a regular diet once her bowels began working when she began having flatus .
Her bowel function was slow to develop and she needed to remain n.p.o. until postoperative day number six .
The patient was also given supplemental tube feedings to supplement her calories and caloric intake .
On postoperative day number seven , the patient was tolerating her clear liquid diet and her tube feeds .
She was started on p.o. medicines and her first Belmont-Gardner drain was pulled due to scant output .
By 2014-08-09 , the patient was tolerating a full solid diet as well as her tube feeds .
Between the two of those , her caloric intake was sufficient for her to sustain herself .
She was discharged to home with services including tube feedings for her home care .
Therefore , she was discharged on 2014-08-09 in good condition .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Metastatic gallbladder cancer .
2. Status post cholecystectomy .
3. Status post transverse colectomy with anastomosis .
4. G tube placement .
5. Feeding jejunostomy .
6. Hypothyroidism .
7. Blood loss requiring transfusion .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Levothyroxine 100 micrograms orally once a day .
2. Pantoprazole one tablet once a day .
3. Ambien 10 mg orally before bed .
4. Tylenol # 3 one tablet every four hours as needed for pain .
5. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at bedtime .
6. Colace 100 mg twice a day .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
Follow-up with the Visiting Nurses Association to arrange assistance with her tube feeding and
her activities of daily living .
The patient is also scheduled for an appointment with Dr. Patterson approximately two weeks after her discharge from the hospital ."

Pt is a 78 yo male with h/o A fib , s/p multiple CVA s, CHF , HTN , DM2 admitted to Mediplex Rehab Hospital Robert on 02-01 with abdominal pain and n/v since that morning .
Pt 's vitals on admission wer significant for T 104 , SBP 100 s, HR in the 120 s.
RUQ U/s demonstrated multiple small gallstones with sludges without evidence of pericholecystic fluid or significant dilatation of the gallbladder .
Surgery was consulted for concern of cholangitis with probable sepsis .
Pt was admitted to the CMED CCU , intubated overnight for ERCP procedure and fluid resuscitation .
The patient was placed on zosyn .
Pt 's INR was eleveted as he was on home coumadin .
He was given 4 units FFP in anticipation of ERCP the following day .
On 02-02 ERCP demonstrated a large filling defect in the distal duct representing a stone with CBD dilatation .
A biliary stent was placed after the removal of the stone .
Pt was extubated the next day .
He was then transferred to the medicine service .
Brief Hospital Course :
Pt is a 78 yo male with atrial fibrillation , s/p multiple CVA s, CHF , HTN , DM2 transferred from the CMED CCU s/p intervention for cholangitis .
1) Acute cholangitis : Pt was admitted to the ICU , intubated , and ERCP performed , likely stone obstructing CBD .
Stent was placed and patient was treated with antibiotics ( Zosyn - > Ciprofloxacin ).
Per ERCP fellow , plan is for patient to return in four weeks to see Dr. Suzanne Davis , at which time he will likely have repeat cholangiogram and removal of stent and stone .
If this is still problematic , pt may also need a sphincterotomy .
Dr.Demby secretary will contact patient at home the week after discharge to schedule this for the end of January .
Pt is to continue ciprofloxacin for a complete 14 day course .
2) Mechanical mitral valve : Anticoagulation was reversed for ERCP .
After this he was anticoagulated with heparin drip .
INR was 1.9 on discharge .
He was given sc lovenox x 1 and will continue this the day after discharge bid for one day .
VNA will check his INR at home and page his PCP with the results .
3) Atrial fibrillation : Rate controlled and on warfarin .
While in the hospital he had several episodes of pauses , none longer than 2.5 seconds .
His digoxin was held and his metoprolol was titrated down from his home dose .
Once the digoxin was no longer having effect , metoprolol was titrated back to home dose .
4) CHF : Pt was oxygen dependent for most of the hospital course , CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema .
He was diuresed with lasix with good effect .
Volume overload likely ocurred in the setting of IV fluids given in the ICU .
Did not require lasix on discharge .
5) E. coli bacteremia / sepsis : Source of acute cholangitis as above .
Pt required 3 day stay in the surgical ICU and intubation as above .
6) Intubation : Pt was 97% on room air on arrival to Cindy , developed rapid ventricular reponse to a fib which was treated , but after that period of time required oxygen , presumably for pulmonary edema .
In the Lori pt was given 3L NS as well as 1 unit of FFP , and oxygen requirements contimued to climb .
In the CMED CCU pt was intubated for ERCP procedure .
He was extubated the next morning ."

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 33 - year-old Asian-Caucasian male with a history of Type 1 diabetes , asthma , alcohol abuse , and personality disorder / depression admitted on 2010-08-28 for persistent hypoglycemia .
The patient complained of diaphoresis , confusion , dizziness , lightheadedness after drinking a 24 ounce beer and taking at least an extra 15 units of NPH insulin the evening of 2010-08-27 ( later reported over 70 U insulin administered from 2.30 PM until time of presentation ) followed by not eating dinner .
His symptoms mildly improved after eating a candy bar .
The EMS was called and found his blood sugar at the time to be 61 and noted to be 41 in the Emergency Department .
He denied any seizure activity , loss of consciousness , incontinence , shortness of breath , fevers , or chills , chest pain , change in urinary or bowel habits , or suicidal ideation .
He has been depressed recently regarding stress with his home life and on the night of his extra insulin doses , his wife had just kicked him out of the house .
He has had four past hospitalizations for attempted suicide with insulin overdosing , usually denied .
The wife also states that he drinks more than he states .
In the Emergency Department , he received 3.5 amps of D50 and then D5 normal saline and D10 normal saline with blood sugars that were slow to increase leading the ICU team to suspect that the patient had taken more insulin than he admitted .
He also had a very positive tox screen for alcohol .
His fingersticks are currently in the 200 s and his normal blood glucose at home ranges between 90-200 per the patient .
The patient also now complains of increased right upper quadrant / right rib cage pain and new headache .
He also complains of chronic photophobia which is unchanged .
He denied visual changes , lightheadedness of dizziness currently , neck stiffness , or pain in any other area .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. HYPOGLYCEMIA :
The patient had been initially very hypoglycemic on admission secondary to overdosing on insulin ; however , with glucose repletion both in the Emergency Department and in the ICU , this resolved and the patient also began to eat .
We checked fingerstick glucoses q.i.d. and at 3:00 a.m.
His glucose on the morning of discharge was about 60 so we opted to decrease his p.m. NPH dose slightly for discharge and continue covering him with sliding scale insulin .
He should also continue having a snack at midnight if able .
It is likely that he required a much greater amount of insulin as an outpatient due to poor compliance with Richard Natalie diet .
2. ALCOHOL ABUSE :
It is likely that the patient continues to drink more than he admits .
He did have past alcoholism consisting of a half a pint of brandy per day for three years but supposedly had quit in 2009-09-03 .
He had been on a diazepam CIWA scale prophylaxis against DT s; however , he had a very low CIWA scale during his entire admission and did not need any benzodiazepines .
This alcohol abuse may be further addressed as an inpatient on the Psychiatry Quincy Medical Center .
We had also requested a Social Work consult regarding this .
3. DEPRESSION vs. Borderline personality disorder :
The patient has had several admissions in the past for attempted suicide with overdose of his insulin and though he denied at this time attempting to end his life , it appears that the social situation of increased stressors corresponding to this time suggest that this is not the truth .
He received a one-to-one sitter during his admission and will be transferred to the Psychiatry HealthSouth New England Rehab Hospital to ensure the patient 's safety and initiate further antidepressant treatment .
He will need close follow-up regarding his depression as an outpatient , although apparently this has been set up for him in the past and he had not followed through .
4. HISTORY OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE :
His blood pressure was fairly low with a maximum of 130s systolic during his admission , thus we did not continue his lisinopril which he had been on in the past .
5. RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT PAIN :
We obtained a right upper quadrant ultrasound as well as LFTs , amylase , and lipase which were all normal .
He had no evidence of cholecystitis or gallstones or any abnormalities with the liver or kidneys .
it is possible that he has had a muscle strain or other musculoskeletal cause .
6. PROPHYLAXIS :
He was put on Pepcid for GI prophylaxis .
7. FLUIDS , ELECTROLYTES , AND NUTRITION :
He complied with Linda Chad diet while hospitalized .
The patient was hyperphosphatemic secondary to overadministration of Neutra-Phos during his ICU stay .
He was given two doses of calcium carbonate 1 gram , and will most likely normalize secondary to both calcium binding and urinary excretion .
He has been asymptomatic ."

HISTORY :
The patient is a 1,770 gram male infant born by stat cesarean section for fetal bradycardia at 30-6/7 weeks gestation to a 29-year-old gravida 3 , para 0 now 1 mother .
The pregnancy was unremarkable until 2015-06-01 when the mother presented to Shriner 's Hospital for Crippled Children for increased blood pressure and proteinuria .
She was transferred to Charles River Hospital and was treated with magnesium sulfate and betamethasone .
The morning of admission the mother developed vaginal bleeding and fetal bradycardia was noted .
Therefore , a stat cesarean section was performed .
The infant emerged limp and without spontaneous respiratory effort .
He was given bag mask ventilation with good response .
Apgar scores were 6 at one minute and 8 at five minutes .
PRENATAL SCREENS :
O+ , hepatitis B surface antigen negative ,
RPR nonreactive , rubella immune .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient remained cardiovascularly stable throughout the admission .
He was noted to have some apnea and bradycardic spells of prematurity and was therefore started on caffeine .
With the initiation of caffeine therapy the patient has had no more apnea or bradycardic events .
2. Respiratory :
The patient was initially started on nasal prong CPAP at 6 and required additional oxygen to 35% .
However by 24 hours he transitioned to low-flow nasal cannula and on day of life five transitioned to room air where he currently remains .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mrs. Wisniewski is a 45-year-old woman with multiple familial cavernous hemangiomas .
She is right-handed .
She was in her usual state of health until one and a half weeks prior to admission .
She developed an ear ache , for which she saw her primary care physician , Evelyn was prescribed cortisone drops .
A few days later she complained of dizziness .
This was mostly described as feeling unsteady on her feet .
She stated that she had trouble knowing if her feet were touching the ground .
She was seen again by primary care physician , Roderick since she had complaints of dizziness , as well as a new complaint of decreased hearing and the sensation of static in her ears , meniere 's disease was considered .
She was given an oral prednisone taper .
This unsteady gait progressed , and then she subsequently started to develop a pins and needle feeling in the face , hands and feet bilaterally .
Her hearing got progressively worse and the sound of static increased .
She was very fatigued .
At an outside hospital , head CT revealed a 1.5 cm diameter hyperdense mass in the pons , slightly off center to the right .
She was transferred here for further care .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mrs. Wisniewski is a 45 - year-old woman with a strong family history of cavernous angiomas .
She has had several prior bleeding events and presented with a subacute bleed in the mid to lower pons .
There was relatively central in location , with only a slight right-sided predominance .
Her physical examination remained relatively unchanged , with resolution of the subtle left hand weakness and right facial weakness .
Her gait remained severely ataxic , likely secondary to sensory deafferentation , as well as involvement of crossing pontine cerebellar fibers .
Therefore , it was recommended that she have aggressive Physical Therapy at an Acute Rehabilitation Center .
The case was discussed with Dr. Harold from the Falmouth Hospital .
He has followed this family in the past and will see her in follow-up .
We will arrange to have a copy of the MRI scans sent to him ."

History of Present Illness :
70 y/o male with h/o CAD s/p LAD PTCA 33 yrs ago , COPD , T2DM , and AICD pocket infection who presented to the Juan on 2017-09-03 with worsening SOB x 5 days and feeling ' cloudy .'
The patient was currently at Hubbard Regional Hospital and began to develop worsening SOB for the past 5 days .
This AM while talking with his daughter on the phone , he was noted to desaturate into the high 80s and he was brought to the The Hospital for Orthopedics Juan for further evaluation .
The patient states that he has felt ' cloudy ' of late which seems to relate to his worsening SOB .
He is not ambulatory and is very deconditioned secondary to several complications within the past two months related to an AICD pocket infection .
He denies any CP , N/V/D , abdominal pain , or HA .
He states that he only uses one pillow to sleep but admits to sleeping at about 30 degrees at rehab .
In the Juan , his VS were 97.8 150/80 88 12 89-94% 3L NC .
He was given Percocet for back pain , Lasix 80 mg IV , and Combivent neb .
For unclear reasons , he was placed on a NRB in the Juan .
Upon arrival to the CCU , he was hemodynamically stable .
He was quickly weaned to 3L O2 via NC , O2 sats 100% .
Brief Hospital Course :
A/P :
70 y/o male with h/o CAD , T2DM , hyperlipidemia , and COPD who presented to the Juan on 2017-09-03 with worsening SOB x 5 days from Morton Hospital & Medical Center .
Pt. was initially admitted to CCU on 2017-09-03 , transferred to Pendleton on 2017-09-05 , triggered on 2017-09-10 for hypotension with BP 67/38 and transferred back to CCU on 2017-09-10 .
He remained fluid overloaded and a swan catheter was placed .
The following issues were addressed during this hospital admission :
1# Cardiac :
Pump
The patient was initially admitted for likely CHF exacerbation .
He was started on a lasix gtt the night of admission with a good response .
He continued to diurese and he was moved to the floor since he no longer required intensive level care .
While on the floor , he continued to be diuresed .
After several days , he became hypotensive and triggered for BPs 60s/30s .
He was given IVF without an adequate response in his pressures .
He was transferred back to the CCU and started on a dopamine gtt .
He diuresed well on the dopamine gtt and his BP was supported .
Gradually , the dopamine gtt was weaned .
However , he still appeared volume overloaded with minimal improvement in his oxygen requirement .
A swan was placed for a more accurate picture of his volume status and he was volume overloaded by swan numbers with an elevated PAD and elevated CVP without an obtainable wedge pressure .
He also had a high CO and low SVR suggestive of sepsis , but he never had an elevated WBC and was afebrile during his entire hospital admission with negative blood , urine , wound , and pleural fluid cultures .
The Lasix drip was eventually changed to IV Lasix boluses , with a net diuresis of over 36 liters for the hospital stay .
He was then transitioned to oral Lasix for maintainence .
The patient had an echo on 2017-09-04 with the results above in detail .
It was unchanged in comparison to 2017-08-14 with similar ventricular function and inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis .
The patient had another echo on 2017-09-14 with no new changes .
At discharge the patient was thought to be euvolemic , satting well on room air and without peripheral edema .
His dry weight is 70.4 kg .
Ischemia
The patient had an initial troponin bump on admission which was most likely secondary to CHF exacerbation .
He was continued on Aspirin , Metoprolol and Lipitor with no further issues .
Rhythm
The patient is completely pacer-dependent , being epicardially paced at 70 .
He is on Amiodarone for post-op afib and this was continued this entire admission .
His underlying rhythm is atrial flutter ; it was unclear whether he had previously been cardioverted .
Anti-coagulation was started with Warfarin 5 mg with a goal of 2-3 and a plan for cardioversion in 6 weeks .
The patient 's INR became supratherapeutic and Coumadin was held .
His coumadin was transitioned to 2 mg and then 1 mg .
His INR continued to flucuate .
He was discharged on 1 mg , but a stable regimen had not been achieved .
His INR will have to be monitored closely unitl his levels are stable .
His INR goal is 02-24 .
2# SOB on admission :
Likely due to CHF exacerbation , with diuresis of over 36 L during his admission .
He had 4 surgeries ( 3 cardiac surgeries ) earlier in the summer , so it is likely that he required copious IVF hydration surrounding these procedures which may have been the cause of his massive fluid overload .
It appears that his diet was regulated at rehab but there is concern for medication non-compliance at rehab , per previous discharge summaries .
On discharge , the patient was maintained on standing diuretics as well as PRN nebs and INH COPD meds .
3# Metabolic Alkalosis / Hypochloremia :
Etiology most likely a combination of contraction alkalosis and / or post-hypercapnia .
This acutely worsened on 2017-09-18 , when the patient was found to have mental status changes and an ABG revealed a CO2 of over 100 , likley due to a depressed respiratory drive secondary to sedatives given for agitation on top of a preexisting alkalosis .
The patient was therefore intubated for ventilation , and continued to be diuresed .
His CO2 improved and he was extubated after a few days .
All sedating medications were held and serial ABGs were trended to follow the resolution of the metabolic alkalosis .
4# Pleural effusions : s/p right thoracentesis on 2017-09-06 , 1600 mL of serosanguinous fluid removed from right pleural space .
Gram stain and cultures were negative , cytology was negative .
The right pleural effusion slowly re-accumulated after tap but resolved after continued diuresis .
Repeat CXR showed improvement of the effusion and on discharge he had been breathing well on room air without complications
5# T2DM :
The patient was started on Glargine for tighter glycemic control and was covered with an insulin sliding scale .
He was monitored with QID fingersticks .
His blood sugars were in the 100s on discharge .
6# Hyperlipidemia :
The patient was continued on his statin .
7# COPD :
The patient was continued on nebs
8# MS changes :
The patient has a history of baseline dementia which was confounded by delerium in the face of metabolic abnormalities .
His mental status improved as his metabolic process was resolved as detailed above .
Neurology was also consulted and a head CT showed old lacunar infarcts but no acute causes for a change in mental status .
An EEG showed mild encephalopathy , but no other findings .
His mental status did clear somewhat with the addition of standing lactulose ; he was discharged on this medication .
9# Hypothyroidism :
The patient was continued on his outpatient dose of Levothyroxine .
10# ? UTI :
The patient was started on levofloxacin at Newton-Wellesley Hospital for a question of UTI based on U/A positive for WBC .
UCx during this hospitalization were negative and Levofloxacin was d/c 'd .
11# Chronic lower back pain :
The patient was treated with a Lidocaine patch and Percocet prn .
Stronger narcotics were avoided given somnolence and MS changes .
12# Wound Care :
The patient has left chest wound and left gluteal pressure ulcer .
Wound care was consulted on 2017-09-05 and they made several recommendations .
For the left gluteal pressure ulcer , they recommended gentle cleansing with normal saline or commercial wound cleaner , thin layer of Duoderm gel , air dry , allevyn foam adhesive over the site , and change every 2 days or prn .
For the left chest wound , they recommended cleansing with commercial wound cleanser , pat dry , pack aquacel AG rope and moisten with saline , cover with dry gauze and change daily .
These recommendations were followed throughout the admission .
13# Voiding :
Pt. failed multiple attempts to void on his own .
Case was discussed with neurology .
He was started on finsateride on the day prior to admission .
He is scheduled to follow up with urology to address this issue .
Until then , his foley should remain in place .

History of Present Illness :
69 y/o female wtih PMH significant for ESRD on HD , type 2 DM , and recent PE resulting in PEA arrest admitted through the Juan with sepsis of unknown etiology .
Pt was recently admitted to The Hospital for Orthopedics from 12-07 thorugh 12-14 with hypotension thought to be secondary to overdiuresis at HD.
However , a septic component to the hypotension was also considered as the pt was found to have citrobacter in her urine and C diff in her stool .
Pt was then discharged to Arbour-Fuller Hospital Senior Life where she was in her normal state of health until three days ago .
Her son reports that she then developed a headache and fevers started three days ago which were treated with tylenol .
Then , this morning she developed fatigue and did not eat well .
He son also notes that she appeared to be working hard to breath .
She was found to be febrile to 101.9 and received levoflox and vancomycin .
Pt was then sent to the The Hospital for Orthopedics Juan for further evaluation .
Per notes , pt denied SOB , CP , and abdominal pain prior to intubation .
She did complain of a left frontal headache .
In the Juan , the pt 's VS were singificant for a fever of 103.8 , tachycardia in the 130s-150s , and initial hypertensive in the 140s .
Her oxygen saturation was 96% on RA but she was tachypneic to 31 .
She was obtunded and was thus intubated for airway protection .
Post-intubation , the pt 's BP acutely dropped to 58/19 in the setting of propofol .
When this medication was discontinued , her BP came back up to the 70s-90s / 30s-50s .
Pt was then initiated on the sepsis protocol .
In the Juan , she received vancomycin , levofloxacin , flagyl , and cefepime ( 2 gm ).
She received a total of 4 liters of NS then was started on levophed for continued hypotension .
Pt is now transferred to the FICU for further care .
Per pt 's son , she is bedbound at baseline due to her multiple LE femur fractures .
Brief Hospital Course :
A/P :
69 y/o female wtih PMH significant for ESRD on HD , type 2 DM , and recent PE resulting in PEA arrest admitted through the Juan with sepsis of unknown etiology .
1. Sepsis / ID- Started on sepsis protocol .
Unclear etiology headache over the three days prior to admission in association with fever was concerning for a CNS etiology .
Covered broadly with vancomycin , flagyl , and cefipime .
Given stress dose steroids empirically and Sanchez stim showed cortisol of 9.3 --> 10.3 therefore steroids continued .
CXR , LP , UA and abdominal CT showed no sign of infection .
PICC line was removed empirically .
Tip could not be cultured due to contamination .
Cultures drawn off the HD cath are negative to date .
Patient 's LE ulcers appear chronic and do not appear to be the source of infection .
Her left knee is slightly erythematous compared to the right but not impressive .
Joint is mobile .
Nasal washings for influenza were negative ; culture pending .
Patient improved over the next few days .
Steroids were discontinued .
On 12-18 flagyl and cefepime were discontinued as all culture data negative to date .
Plan to continue vancomycin for 08-19 day course to treat empiric line infection .
Urine culture came back positive for VRE , however , since patient improved without treatement ( ie Linezolid ) initially .
After transfer to the floor when she was stable .
On the floor the Vancomycin was discontinued as the catheter tip culture was negative .
ID was consulted who suggested broad spectrum antibiotics if she were to spike .
When pt spiked a temperature and became hypotensive she was started on Linezolid was started for presumed VRE infection in the urine .
She will be treated for total 14 day course .
She was also started on fluconazole for yeast in the urine , to be treated with fluconazole for total 7 days .
She was given Flagyl for presumed C. Diff. Colitis , however this was stopped when C. Diff B toxin came back negative on 2019-01-10 .
The tunneled catheter line was changed over a wire and the tip was also negative .
2. Respiratory - Intubated for airway protection due to change in mental status .
Extubated 12-28 with no incident .
3. ECG changes - Patient had an episode of chest pain during her hospital stay that was both right and left sided with no radiation and no associated symptoms .
ECG showed new diffuse TWI in all leads .
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and were normal .
Echo was obtained which showed WMA and EF of 35-40% .
Pt was note started on ASA as she does not tolerate this well , BB was also not started given SBPs in the 110s .
Statin was also deffered .
She may be started on ASA , BB , statin by PCP as Stephen .
4. Shoulder fracture - Patient is s/p a left hip fracture ( decision not to operate ) and a left shoulder fracture with hemiarthroplasty 11-14 .
Patient was found to have a new humerus fracture distal to the hardware on film this admission .
Assumed to be secondary to trauma when moving patient into ambulance .
CMED service was consulted and recommended wtd woulnd care and sling at all times .
Wound care should be continued as described after discharge .
5. Type 2 DM - Patient was initially covered with an insulin drip while septic and then transitioned back to insulin sliding scale .
6. ESRD on HD - Pt has ESRD secondary to her DM and is on HD .
She was dialysed but was slightly limited by hypotension .
Dialyzed 12-28 with plan to dialyze again 12-31 .
Her dialysis was managed by renal service in house .
7. PE ( 11-14 )- On heparin drip .
Restared coumadin on 12-29 .
Heparin discontinued on 01-01 when INR was 2.0 .
Coumadin was stopped and she received fFP for tunneled line change over a wire .
Coumadin was restarted at a dose of 2 mg qhs .
This should be titrated after discharge for INR goal of 2-3 .
8. PVD :
Dry gangrene of toes bilaterally w/ necrosis of the heels and posterior calf .
Continue to monitor for sign of infection .
On vit C. and zinc as well to aid w/ wound healing .
Wound care consult given anasarca to prevent decub .
9. Left UE markedly more edematous than right UE , this could be from fracture , or there could be a clot , an abscess in the area also a possiblity .
Ultrasound without clot .
Continue elevation and tight dressing to LUE >
10. Access - Left IJ placed 12-26 in Juan was discontinued during the hospitilization .
Right dialysis catheter ( 2018-11-05 ) was changed over a wire 2019-01-08 .
PICC line placed 2019-01-08 , this should be discontinued immediately after pt finishes the linezolid course .
11. Code status - Initially full code then made DNR / DNI after family meeting on 12-27 .
Made full code again on 12-30 after family meeting with son .
Larry would like everything done .
12. Communication - With pt 's son .
His name is Andrea and his phone number is 794 1029 x. 1385 ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 59 year old male with a past medical history significant for an atrioseptal defect repair at age 18 , congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45% and a recent cardiac myocardial infarction , pulmonary hypertension and mitral regurgitation , and atrial fibrillation .
He was seen by his primary care physician the day before admission and complained of two weeks of increasing shortness of breath and fatigue , weight gain and abdominal fullness .
He was sent to the Emergency Department for further evaluation .
The patient reported feeling at his baseline with chronic mild dyspnea on exertion until two weeks prior to admission .
During this period he had also been weaned off of his Digoxin starting early in February .
Over the two weeks prior to admission he had noticed an increasing heart rate from his baseline in the 60s to a heart rate in the 120s .
He had also some increased shortness of breath and a 10 pound weight gain and new three to four pillow orthopnea with a dry cough .
He denied fevers , chills , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or diaphoresis .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Hypotension - The patient was initially mildly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s .
Upon admission it was unclear whether or not the patient was volume overloaded or volume depleted .
Initially he was treated with intravenous fluids with a dramatic response in his systolic blood pressure .
However , subsequent it was determined that the patient 's hypotension may have been related to his rapid ventricular response and right heart failure .
Therefore the focus of treatment was changed to controlling his rate .
2. Atrial fibrillation - The patient 's Digoxin had been weaned off prior to his admission .
It was felt that this potentially had lead to his atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response .
The patient was loaded once again with Digoxin and his beta blocker was increased to 100 mg of Lopressor , three times a day .
In addition the patient was started on Verapamil since his heart rate had remained mildly tachycardiac in the low 100s .
3. Congestive heart failure - During the initial course of the patient 's admission , it was unclear as to whether or not he was volume overloaded or volume depleted .
The patient was initially treated with intravenous fluids , however , subsequently he was diuresed when he became symptomatic and short of breath .
Chest x-rays revealed evidence of congestive heart failure .
The decision was made to have the patient undergo a cardiac catheterization to fully evaluate the hemodynamics to determine the etiology of the patient 's heart failure .
In addition , plans were made to evaluate the patient 's cardiac arteries to determine if he had any component of ischemic cardiomyopathy .
4. Abnormal liver function tests - The patient had an isolated , elevated alkaline phosphatase with a confirmatory elevation in his gamma glutamyl transferase .
An ultrasound of the right upper quadrant did not reveal any cholelithiasis or cholecystitis , however , an irregular hepatic contour was seen which is suggestive of underlying chronic liver disease .
There was some concern that the patient may have a partial biliary obstruction and the patient was sent for an magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography to further evaluate the biliary system .
Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography did not reveal any evidence of biliary dilatation or of any obstructing pancreatic mass .
Again seen was a slightly irregular contour of the liver with dilated hepatic veins suggesting chronic hepatic vascular congestion .
The patient also revealed a prior history of heavy alcohol use for approximately 20 years , during the mid 1950s to mid 1970s .
It was felt that he may have had some component of vascular congestion from his congestive heart failure as well as possibly some mild cirrhotic changes secondary to his previous alcohol use .
5. Fall - The patient had a mechanical fall during his admission .
He did not sleep at all the night before and was extremely fatigued .
He was walking in the hall , dragging his intravenous pole when he tripped over the foot of the pole and lost his balance .
He fell backwards , landing on his buttocks and bumped his head .
His neurological examination at that time was nonfocal and the head was atraumatic without any evidence of a hematoma .
A computerized axial tomography scan of his head at that time did not reveal any extra or intracranial hemorrhage .
6. Rectal bleeding - The patient has a history of rectal bleeding , ever since his brachytherapy for his prostate cancer .
The patient has been treated with Argon laser therapy in the past for his rectal bleeding and it is recommended that he follow up with his gastroenterologist for repeat Argon laser therapy ."

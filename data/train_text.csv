HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
A 40-year-old female with history of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction in 2016-09-30 with stent to the LAD and 50% to the mid LAD , had instent restenosis in 2017-04-02 and then underwent brachytherapy to the RCA , who presented to Baldpate Hospital with several weeks of chest pain similar to her anginal equivalent and MI in the past .
It started at rest .
No relief with nitroglycerin x3 .
Radiates to the left arm .
Positive shortness of breath .
Troponins have been less than 0.01.
With history , will go for cardiac catheterization evaluation .
Still getting chest pain intermittently , but relieved by morphine sulfate .
Was on a Heparin and nitroglycerin drip with only intermittent relief .
HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Chest pain :
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction .
However , with her history of disease , patient underwent a cardiac catheterization .
The patient was found at cardiac catheterization to have mild diffuse instent restenosis in the mid stent , otherwise hemodynamically normal and the coronary arteries otherwise were without flow-limiting stenoses .
The patient was then continued on her cardiac medications .
It was felt that if we attempted aspirin desensitize her while an inpatient , then she would benefit from the use of aspirin and Plavix .
The patient was sent to the CCU and underwent aspirin desensitization protocol , which she tolerated well .
She had mild worsening of her asthma attacks , which was relieved by Benadryl and occasionally albuterol .
The patient found that if she took the aspirin in the evening with her Benadryl that she takes for sleep , that the asthma exacerbation did not occur .
Aspirin no longer should be considered an allergy for this patient , and she is going to take this as an outpatient .
2. Hyperlipidemia :
The patient 's Lipitor was increased to 80 mg q.d.
3. Back pain :
This is a chronic issue and was controlled with Flexeril and Vicodin ."

MEDICINE
History of Present Illness :
46 - yo-man w/ active cocaine use presents w/ LE edema .
10 days ago , he developed b/l LE edema that has gotten progressively worse until now .
Three days ago , he developed dyspnea on exertion when climbing stairs , assoc w/ 2-pillow orthopnea and PND .
He denies any recent chest pain , palpitations , headache , confusion , weakness , numbness , abd pain , or hematuria .
No recent viral syndromes or URI s.
He does admit to cocaine use last night .
Today , his wife convinced him to present to the Deanna for evaluation .
In the Deanna , his BP was 230/170 .
BNP was elevated at 7500 .
CXR revealed evidence of cardiomegaly and pulm edema .
He was treated w/ ASA 325 mg , lasix 10 mg IV , and hydralazine 10 mg IV x 2 .
He responded well to lasix w/ good UOP , but diastolic BP remained elevated at 170 , prompting initiation of nitroprusside gtt .
He is now admitted to the CCU for further care .
Brief Hospital Course :
46 - yo-man w/ cocaine abuse presents w/ LE edema and DOE likely from diastolic heart failure in the setting of cocaine use complicated by hypertensive urgency .
Hypertensive urgency :
BP 230/170 on presentation , most likely from chronic HTN exacerbated by cocaine use .
No signs of end-organ damage at present except for elevated creatinine , which is more likely a chronic problem .
The patient was started on labetalol and Lisinopril .
His blood pressure was taken down from 230 systolic to approx 160 systolic / 100 diastolic on discharge .
His lower extremity edema improved with diuresis .
An echo performed on admission showed an LF EF of 25% .
It is hoped with good blood pressure control and use of an ACE-I with follow up in addition to cocaine abstaining will improved his cardiac function .
Renal Failure : creatinine on admission was 1.6 Likely acute hypertensive nephropathy plus probalbe long-standing hypertensive disease .
discharged on ACE-I .
Substance Use : Social work saw patient and counceled him regarding substance abuse .
Discharged with Margaret Hallock , cardiology follow up as well as scheduled appointment with a new PCP @ Newton Health Center ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Breunlinke is a 70-year-old patient of Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in California .
She is referred for progressive angina .
She had rheumatoid fever as a child and a heart murmur noted but no further testing .
She has used antibiotic prophylaxis since 1980 .
In 1980 she had quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery by Dr. Elks at Feargunwake Otacaa Community Hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded .
In October , 1989 , Dr. No re-did her bypass operation .
She had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 .
In 1993 she had a DDD pacemaker for complete heart block .
She had exertional angina at that time .
In November , 1997 she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to Ona Hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis , high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft .
She had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis .
Since that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning , radiating to the left neck and arm , relieved by nitroglycerin .
She was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty .
Because these symptoms have been increasing , particularly at cardiac rehabilitation , she was referred here .
In May , 1998 she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic .
She had diffuse ischemic ST segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect .
She has had no syncope .
Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol .
She has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother , sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction .
She is a remote cigarette smoker .
She also has a history of lactose intolerance , peptic ulcer disease , with a remote gastrointestinal bleed and multiple ectopic pregnancies and mid term miscarriages .
She has had a total abdominal hysterectomy .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is a widow for 20 years and retired 18 years from Palmci
She lives alone .
Her son , Nertland is nearby and he works at the Em Nysonken Medical Center on Verville .
They live in Ohio .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory .
There , her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44/17 .
Her left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex .
She had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction .
Her native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch .
The saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded .
The left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded .
The saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis , but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery .
This was considered her culprit lesion .
This was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft .
In addition , it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs .
Her left internal mammary artery was also unused .
It was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead .
She would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing .
This was intermittent .
The P wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed .
The patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker .
It was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure .
Her pacemaker was set to a VVI mode which sensed appropriately .
She was in sinus rhythm with most of the time .
When her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina .
Carotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable .
The situation was reviewed with Dr. Niste Graft .
He felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction .
For this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates .
The situation was reviewed with Dr. No of the Pacemaker Service .
On August 20 , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a CPI unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm. , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing .
There was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads .
It just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode .
She tolerated this well .
Her medications were resumed .
She ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two failed bypass graft procedure by Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in Bi Masase , KS .

He states he had onset of this pain today ; described as anterior chest pain with radiation to right shoulder , 09-26 , was increasing over the course of 45 minutes to 1 hour ( occurred after arrested ).
He states that he also felt SOB and diaphoretic but denies n/v/palpitations .
He reports that the pain was increasing in intensity .
He was brought to Providence Behavioral Health Hospital where he was found to have positive urine cocaine , EKG with new 2-7392 W. Second Cr. elevations in the anterior leads ( v2-5 ) and some ST depressions in II , III , AvF .
He was given lopressor 5 mg x 2 ( 3rd dose given by medflight , 5 mg morphine , ativan , nitro gtt , heparin , and integrillin .
Pain was 12-28 at time of transfer .
In the cath lab , he was found to have hazy plaque in LAD ( prior stent ) , 80% hazy plaque in circumflex , and a totally occluded PLB ( with collaterals ) .
1 cypher stent was place in the LAD while 2 were placed in Lcx .
Right system was not intervened upon , for the PLB was unable to be crossed by wire .
He was transferred to the CCU for observation .
Brief Hospital Course :
1. CAD : presented with anginal symptoms and EKG changes ( STEMI ) , with cardiac catheterization revealing lesions in LAD , LcX , and PLB .
Unclear if hazy lesions significant or if this was cocaine induced vasospasm .
LAD and LCX were stented , but PLB could not be crossed by guidewire ( were collaterals ) .

Medical ICU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Patient is a 53 - year-old female found down in hotel room by EMS with change in mental status and lethargy .
A suicide note found at the scene referenced multiple medical problems as well as suggested ingestion of beta blocker , muscle relaxant , and Neurontin .
Vital signs were stable on arrival in the David , but the patient was minimally responsive and subsequently intubated for airway protection .
Patient initially given 2 mg of Narcan , 4 amps of sodium bicarb , and 5 grams of activated charcoal .
Patient 's blood pressures were noted to decrease systolics to the 80s , which responded to IV fluids and insulin / glucose drips .
Also noted to be bradycardic to the 50s , which responded to atropine .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
In summary , patient is a 53 - year-old female with multiple medical problems and history of depression with intentional overdose of barbiturates , opiates , Tylenol , and beta blocker .
CMED :
Patient was maintained on insulin , D10 and glucagon drips to maintain her hemodynamics .
This was achieved with good effect , and they were subsequently weaned off .
Patient was able to be extubated on hospital day three .
Psychiatry was consulted after the patient was extubated , and felt that patient had a high suicide risk , and plan was for her to be admitted to the Psychiatry service once medically stable .
Patient 's renal function remained stable and her CKs trended down gradually .
Patient remained on suicide precautions , but was deemed not to need ICU level monitoring , and was transferred to the floor on 01-11 .
In the a.m. of 01/08 , the patient experienced episode of tongue biting , unresponsiveness , disorientation .
Was loaded on Dilantin .
Became progressively hypoxic and tachypneic throughout the day with respiratory rates of 30-40 with a max respiratory rate of 116 , tachycardia to 120s .
Patient subsequently was transferred back to the CMED CCU on 2017-01-13 for further monitoring .
Patient 's hypoxia was felt most likely to be caused by pneumonia .
She was started on appropriate antibiotics .
Etiology of patient 's tachypnea was unclear .
Initially , the patient 's etiology of seizure was not quite clear , but thought possibly secondary to alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal .
She received EEG , MRI , LP .
Subsequently EEG was noted to have no seizure activity .
MRI was suboptimal due to motion artifact and LP was unremarkable .
Despite absence of seizure activity on EEG , patient was continued on Dilantin .
Her delirium was felt possibly secondary to withdrawal versus toxic metabolic , but gradually improved slowly , and therefore patient did not receive treatment for barbiturate withdrawal .
Her mental status , tachypnea , and hypoxia all improved , and patient was subsequently transferred back to the floor medical team on 2017-01-15 .
While on the floor , the patient 's mental status was noted to be improved back at baseline compared to that back to the CMED CCU , and she exhibited no evidence of barbiturate withdrawal .
She was continued on suicide precautions with a one-to-one sitter , and plan was for psychiatric admission when medical issues had resolved .
On 2017-01-16 , the night float intern was called to see the patient as she was unresponsive .
Patient unresponsive to verbal command , sternal rub .
Pupils were fixed and dilated .
Patient noted to be without corneal reflexes , spontaneous breathing , heart sounds , or palpable pulses .
Patient was pronounced dead at 6:15 a.m. on 2017-01-16 .
Patient 's family was notified and declined autopsy .
Given the sudden unexpected nature of patient 's death , the medical examiner was contacted and the case was accepted .
Of note at time of death , patient was DNR / DNI .
This was initiated after several conversations with the patient 's mother , who stated that the patient had desired to be DNR / DNI for many years , not just in the recent past .
These facts were confirmed via separate conversations with both the patient 's lawyer and her primary care physician .

TRAUMA SER
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 20 year old driver was in a major motor vehicle accident and brought to the Emergency Saints Medical Center following this , with multiple trauma .
The patient was an unrestrained driver in a car versus tree .
He was involved in a long extrication with a blood pressure of 88 at the scene .
Upon extrication from the vehicle , he was intubated and transported to the Emergency Room .
He was tachycardic with an initial blood pressure of 120 / palpable .
A groin line was placed and the patient was sedated and paralyzed .
He was resuscitated with Crystalloid and remained hemodynamically stable .
He had a grossly deformed left lower extremity .
On examination , Belmont Coma Scale was 6T ; blood pressure was 120 / palpable with a heart rate of 122 .
The trachea was midline .
The abdomen was soft .
Rectal was heme positive with normal prostate .
There were no meatal blood .
The left femur was grossly deformed with a pinhole opening in the lateral thigh .
His left forearm was also grossly deformed .
There is no step-off at the back .
Admission laboratories included a hematocrit of 43.3 and white blood cell count of 25.2 , normal electrolytes and amylase of 98 .
Arterial blood gas showed a mild metabolic acidosis .
Additional assay shows slight widening of the mediastinum on chest x-ray .
The CT scan of the head and chest were negative .
There was a small liver laceration seen on the A/P pelvis .
There was a distal ulnar and radial fracture as well as a left mid-shaft comminuted fracture of the femur .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit .
He was also seen by the Orthopedics Service and Neurosurgical Service .
He went to the Operating Room quickly and had an intramedullary rodding of the femur and open reduction and internal fixation of the radius and ulna .
He was evaluated by Neurosurgery for his head injury which showed multiple contusions in the frontal lobe .
He was extubated on postoperative day two .
He did have some blood loss anemia with a hematocrit of 20.9 .
A repeat CT scan showed no change .
He was begun on Physical Therapy but remained agitated .
He was discharged to the Floor .
His hematocrit remained stable .
His cervical spine was cleared .
The patient was seen by Psychiatry due to some delirium and question of suicidal ideation .
He was also evaluated by the Neuro-Rehabilitation Service who thought that he had a post-head injury syndrome with diffuse cognitive deficits .
He continued to have some episodes of agitation which were treated with medication .
He required some sedation and restraint and was begun on whatever Physical Therapy he could have given his head injury .
He was continued to be followed by Psychiatry and then was casted by Orthopedics .
He continued to have episodes of confusion .
He removed the cast that had been placed and then a long-leg cast was then placed so it would be difficult for him to remove or to ambulate on his leg , which might jeopardize his closure .
It continued to be somewhat difficult to control his activity and Rehabilitation Screen was in place but there was difficulty finding the appropriate facility .
His family was also involved in his care and orientation .
He does of BuSpar , Trazodone and Haldol were continued and were adjusted by Psychiatry .
He was continued on observation and sitters and finally became more docile and cooperative .
He was continued on Physical Therapy and with his mother present , he began to follow commands much more appropriately and was able to be rehabilitated .
He was finally sent home for home rehabilitation on 2011-02-23 .
FINAL DIAGNOSES :
1. Multiple trauma with severe frontal head injury .
2. Open fracture of the femur .
3. Radial and ulnar fractures .
4. Liver laceration .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 104 year old female patient with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , coronary artery disease , hypertension and cerebrovascular accident who presents with shortness of breath and cough .
The patient states that she has no idea why she was brought to the Emergency Department and denies any symptoms .
She reports an occasional nonproductive cough that she has had_ for years _and feels that she has been experiencing alternating chills and feeling hot .
A progress note in the patient 's chart from her assisted living facility indicates that the patient has had shortness of breath and cough for one day with chills but no fever .
She has been recently evaluated as an outpatient for bradycardia .
She was seen by her cardiologist , Dr. Clements and had a Holter monitor on 2015-05-01 , that showed first degree AV block with a rate that ranged between 35 to 53 beats per minute .
In the Emergency Department , the patient was given nebulizer treatment , started on antibiotics for presumed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation .
She was noted to have lateral ST depressions and given Aspirin .
She continues to deny chest pain , palpitations , shortness of breath , fevers , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , bright red blood per rectum , melena , dysuria , urinary frequency and urgency .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Shortness of breath - Though the patient denied shortness of breath on admission , a progress note from
Norwood nursing facility suggested that the patient had been having shortness of breath and cough for approximately one day with difficulty ambulating , needing to travel in a wheelchair .
The patient was afebrile on admission with a normal white blood cell count but had significant wheezing and rales on physical examination with a possible left lower lobe opacity seen on chest x-ray .
The etiology of the patient 's shortness of breath was considered a likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and the patient was started on Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers .
The patient was also started on Doxycycline given the concern for pneumonia on chest x-ray .
She was also continued on steroids given evidence of severe airway obstruction .
The patient 's shortness of breath was also considered possibly related to a coronary event and she was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction .
The patient 's enzymes were cycled and were negative .
The patient 's electrocardiogram performed on hospital day number two was concerning for 2:1 heart block and the cardiology consult service was contacted for evaluation .
The patient was taken to the Coronary Care Unit late on hospital day number two and received a temporary wire .
The following day the patient received a permanent dual chamber rate responsive pacemaker .
The patient was transferred back to the general medicine service where she continued to exhibit signs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and nebulizers , steroids and antibiotics were continued .
The patient 's respiratory status improved throughout the remainder of her hospitalization and oxygen was eventually weaned .
Once the patient was transferred out of the Coronary Care Unit , she appeared to have an element of heart failure in addition to her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
She was given 20 mg of intravenous Lasix with impressive urine output and improvement in her overall fluid status .
The patient was eventually restarted on her outpatient dose of Lasix once her renal function improved to baseline and remained hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of her hospitalization .
Heart block - As noted previously , the patient 's electrocardiogram was significant for a 2:1 heart block and cardiology consult service was contacted for evaluation .
The patient received a temporary pacing wire on the evening of hospital day number two and on hospital day number three received a dual chamber pacemaker .
Renal - The patient was admitted with a creatinine of 1.8 , considered likely secondary to hypovolemia .
Her calculated fractional excretion of sodium was 0.13 percent suggesting a prerenal cause .
The patient 's creatinine improved to 1.1 with hydration .
Once the patient 's creatinine had improved to baseline , her Lasix and ace inhibitor were restarted and the patient 's creatinine was noted to be stable .
Gastrointestinal - The patient was admitted with a history of gastrointestinal bleed with guaiac positive stools on admission .
Her hematocrit was noted to trend down after transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells on admission .
Given guaiac positive stools and her history of gastrointestinal bleed in addition to use of steroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation , the gastroenterology consult service was contacted .
The results of that consultation and potential esophagogastroduodenoscopy are pending at the time of dictation .
Hypertension - The patient had moderate control of her blood pressure throughout her admission .
Her calcium channel blocker and ace inhibitor were continued .
Hematology - As noted previously , the patient 's hematocrit was noted to drop after transfusion with one unit of packed red blood cells on admission .
Given guaiac positive stools and the patient 's history of gastrointestinal bleed , gastroenterology consult service was contacted for possible esophagogastroduodenoscopy and/or colonoscopy .
The results of this consultation are pending at the time of dictation .
The remainder of the Hubbard Regional Hospital hospital course , discharge diagnoses , medications and follow-up will be dictated at the time of discharge .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Le is a seventy three year old male who presents to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital , following a self inflicted gunshot wound to the head .
Mr. Le was found in bed with a 32 caliber revolver at his side .
The patient was apparently alone at home , his neighbors heard a single shot , and the paramedics were called .
Upon arrival , they found the patient in bed , with notes nearby , listing his funeral home preferences and information on his next of kin .
The patient indicates that his neighbors were making excessive noise upstairs from his dwelling , and he found it unbearable .
He therefore decided to take his life with a gun which he had found in the house .
Apparently , the gun belonged to his father .
On further questioning , the patient described that his father passed away approximately forty to fifty years prior to his admission , and the gun was found in a box in their home .
The patient expressed concern that he had several utility bills that he was unable to pay .
The patient &apos;s sister died eight years prior to the patient &apos;s admission of leukemia , and he otherwise has no next of kin with the exception of one brother in Washington , with whom his relationship is tenuous .
On initial questioning , however , the patient denies any recent losses .
On admission , the patient denies any suicidal or homicidal ideation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital , on the Neurological Surgery Service of Lupevickette L. Ca , M.D.
Prior to his admission , the patient &apos;s gunshot wound was sutured close in the emergency room .
The patient was placed on suicide precautions , and was hydrated with an infusion of intravenous fluid .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Psychiatry Service , who began a battery of testing , which continues at the time of discharge .
The Consulting Psychiatrist recommended a minimum of 2 point restraints at all times , and recommended the patient be monitored by a sitter .
Allowing the patient to ambulate was not recommended .
From a medical standpoint , the patient did well .
He was initially admitted to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit where he was closely monitored during the first two days of his hospitalization .
The chief obstacle was bringing his blood pressure under control and this was ultimately achieved with a combination of Captopril and Nifedipine .
After his blood pressure had stabilized , the patient was transferred to the Neurology Ward .
Close monitoring demonstrated his blood pressure to be stable and within an acceptable rang on his dosage regimen .
The Psychiatry Service followed up extensively with the patient , and his Psychiatric progress is detailed in the Psychiatry transfer note .
By the 7th hospital day , the patient was medically stable .
He had undergone full Psychiatric evaluation , and was prepared for transfer to a Psychiatric Hospital .
Therefore , because of his need for intense psychiatric care , the patient is discharged to the Vo Black Doylestrictshore Ft. Clinics Medical Center on the 7th hospital day ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 28-year-old woman who is HIV positive for two years .
She presented with left upper quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting which is a long-standing complaint .
She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child .
She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive .
She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission .
At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity .
She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI .
She has complaints of nausea and vomiting as well as left upper quadrant pain on and off getting progressively worse over the past month .
She has had similar pain intermittently for last year .
She described the pain as a burning pain which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise .
She has no relief from antacids or H2 blockers .
In 10/92 , she had a CT scan which showed fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely with a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver .
She had a normal pancreas at that time , however , hyperdense kidneys .
Her alkaline phosphatase was slightly elevated but otherwise relatively normal .
Her amylase was mildly elevated but has been down since then .
The patient has had progressive failure to thrive and steady weight loss .
She was brought in for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently sedated and readmitted at this time for a GI work-up as well as an evaluation of new abscess in her left lower calf and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle .
She was also admitted to be connected up with social services for HIV patients .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and many cultures were sent which were all negative .
She did not have any of her pain in the hospital .
On the third hospital day , she did have some pain and was treated with Percocet .
She went for a debridement of her left calf lesion on 10/2/93 and was started empirically on IV ceftriaxone which was changed to po doxycycline on the day of discharge .
A follow-up CT scan was done which did not show any evidence for splenomegaly or hepatomegaly .
The 1 cm cyst which was seen in 10/92 was still present .
There was a question of a cyst in her kidney with a stone right below the cyst , although this did not seem to be clinically significant ."

09/16/2006
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 76 year old white male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who has had several recent admissions to Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital for respiratory insuffiencey most often secondary to pneumonia .
He was most recently discharged from Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital on 03/06/99 and was then transferred to Linghs County Medical Center from which he was discharged on 03/20/99 .
The patient was doing relatively at home until one day prior to admission he complained discomfort over a suprapubic catheter area .
The patient had missed his usual monthly change of his suprapubic catheter and felt discomfort and noticed some blood at the site of the catheter .
The patient was brought to the Emergency Room one day prior to admission where he was evaluated by Urology and had his catheter changed .
The patient at that time noted slight shortness of breath but was sent home anyway .
On the day of admission the patient noticed increasing shortness of breath .
The patient was noted to be confused and to be disoriented toward the end of the day after complaining of shortness of breath for most of the day .
The patient denies any recent upper respiratory infections , no fevers , no chills , no change in cough , sputum .
He also denies any chest pain .
No orthopnea .
No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
The patient had been taking his usual medications and using his nasal oxygen at home .
By the time the patient arrived at the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room he was in moderate respiratory distress .
His initial blood gases on 40% 02 was P02 102 , PC02 115 , PH 7.11 .
The patient was given respiratory therapy in the way of nebulizer treatments in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room because of a longstanding desire by patient and family to refrain from intubation to be considered Do Not Resuscitate .
The patient was not intubated .
However he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he received continuous respiratory therapy in theway of Albuterol nebulizers as well as nasal oxygen , intravenous steroids and intravenous antibiotics .
A chest x-ray in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital Emergency Room showed new changes on his chest x-ray on top of his usual severe bilateral emphysema_____ with scarring in both lungs .
There were new air space opacifications in the left apex and the right lower lobe .
These were thought to be consistent either with pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was stabilized in the Medical Intensive Care Unit .
He stayed in the unit for about one day .
During that period of time he received nebulizer treatments with Albuterol .
He was also started on intravenous Ticarcillin for possible gram negative pneumonia .
He was diuresed with intravenous Lasix to which he responded with at lease a 2L urine output on the first day and 1.5L the second day .
After one day in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient was stable enough to go to the floor where he continued the rest of his treatment .
This consisted of continued nebulizer treatments as well as intravenous antibiotics and intravenous Solu-Medrol .
As the patient &apos;s diuresis continued his respiratory status improved .
A chest x-ray showed clearing of the opacities in the chest x-ray that were consistent with pulmonary edema because he continued to have some abnormality in the right lower lobe .
The patient was continued on antibiotics for possible pneumonia .
The antibiotic chosen was Levaquin 500 mg 1 tab per day .
This was started on 4/2/99 and should be continued for ten days .
The Ticarcillin was stopped after two days when it was felt that he did not have a serious pneumonia .
The patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to improve but towards the last 2-3 days of his hospitalization the amount of improvement was minimal .
It was felt that his respiratory status has been maximally treated by then .
The patient &apos;s major improvement came after the first two days with brisk diuresis with Lasix .
While in the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital the patient on 4/4/99 complained of mild epigastric discomfort because he was put in Cimetidine while in the Intensive Care Unit for prophylaxis against peptic ulcer disease .
The patient was upgraded to Prilosec 20 mg per day for possible treatment of gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease .
The patient did have any nausea , vomiting or evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding .
The patient &apos;s abdominal pain should be followed over the next week or so in case it does not respond to Prilosec .
While in Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital the patient was never able to get out of bed and walk independently .
It is hoped that when he is transferred to a rehab facility that he will continue with physical therapy to regain his strength and regain independence in activities of daily living .
Discussion with the family regarding the possibility of sending him to a nursing home was entertained however the family strongly refused to allow him to go a nursing home .
They wanted the patient to return to his home after a stay at a rehab facility ."

Ms. Bridge is a 74 y/o female admitted to outside hospital on 2015-10-21 with chest discomfort , vomiting and shortness of breath .
Initial EKG showed ST depressions , but cardiac enzymes were not elevated .
She eventually underwent a cardiac cath to assess coronary disease which revealed three vessel coronary artery disease .
She was then transferred to The Hospital for Orthopedics for surgical intervention .
Brief Hospital Course :
Ms. Bridge was admitted from OSH for coronary artery bypass surgery .
She underwent usual pre-operative testing along with carotid ultrasound .
CNIS revealed carotid stenosis and she ultimately underwent left carotid stenting by vascular surgery on 10-30 .
Please see report for details .
On 11-02 she was brought to the operating room where she underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 2 .
Please see operative report for surgical details .
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition .
Later on op day sedation was weaned , she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated .
On post-op day one chest tubes were removed and beta blockers and diuretics were initiated .
She was gently diuresed towards her pre-op weight .
Also on this day she was transferred to the SDU .
Early on post-op day two Ms. Bridge had an episode of aphasia .
She underwent an immediate head CT and Neuro consult and was transferred back to the CSRU .
CT was negative and she returned to baseline neuro status without deficits by arrival to CSRU .
Neurology concluded episode was most concerning for TIA .
Epicardial pacing wires were removed on post-op day four .
After remaining stable in the CSRU for several days without change in neuro status she was transferred back to the SDU on post-op day four .
She was then started on Heparin with transition to Coumadin ( goal INR of 2-3 secondary to h/o bilateral DVT 's).
During entire post-op course she was followed by physical therapy for strength and mobility .
She continued to improve steadily over the next several days without any other post-op

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 55 - year-old Caucasian speaking male who is a smoker and has a family history of coronary artery disease , as well as a personal history of hypertension , who experienced multiple episodes of 10/10 substernal chest pain radiating down his left arm last night with his daily activities .
Each episode lasted approximately 15 minutes in duration and resolved on their own .
This morning while landscaping the patient had unremitting 12-05 pain with shortness of breath and diaphoresis .
He presented to Deaconess-Nashoba Hospital Hospital and the first EKG was found to have ST elevations in V1-V3 of 1-2 mm with T wave inversions in V4-6 , I and L , which progressed to 3-0167 W. Seventh Ave. elevations within 20 minutes .
Heparin and nitroglycerin drip were started with 10 mg of IV Retavase half dose .
He was transferred to the North Adams Regional Hospital for catheterization .
Once at Hahnemann General Hospital he received heparin and Integrilin .
Coronary angiography revealed left main , left circumflex and RCA normal and left LAD with 99% midstenosis .
A Hepacoat stent was placed with no residuals but good flow after nitroglycerin and diltiazem .
The chest pain persisted afterwards and a relook catheterization was performed that revealed no occlusions .
The right heart catheterization revealed a cardiac output index of 4.11 and 2.15 respectively .
RA pressure was 13 , RV pressure 45/7 , wedge 27 and PA pressures of 42/21 .
He was transferred to the CC for monitoring and he denied having further pain , shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting .
At baseline the patient denies any previous chest pain , pressure , dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea , PND or palpitations .

Mr. Vessels &apos;s postoperative course has been marked by CMV infection , hypertension , poorly controlled lipids , peripheral vascular disease , and chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 1.8 or so .
Recently he had documented coronary angiography based on a catheterization performed in January 1996 with moderate to diffuse atherosclerosis .
A repeat angiogram performed a year later showed marked progression of coronary allograft disease .
A biopsy at that time revealed grade 1B rejection with endothelialitis and eosinophils .
He was treated with pulsed IV steroids and Imuran , was augmented with mycophenolate Mofetil .
Chest x-ray showed cariogenic pulmonary edema and he was faring poorly .
Prior to admission he was seen approximately 1 week in the office with mild congestive heart failure .
An echocardiogram then revealed an ejection fraction of 40% and an endomyocardial biopsy revealed no ejection .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the hospital via the emergency room where a bedside echocardiogram was performed .
The echocardiogram revealed no pericardial effusion , an ejection fraction of 30% and worsening systolic dysfunction .
Hydrocortisone was given 1 g in an attempt to reverse what was thought to be aggressive coronary allograft vasculopathy .
The patient diuresed and responded to Lasix 100 mg administered in the emergency room and was admitted to a monitored bed .
At 2:30 AM the following morning the patient was found in cardiac arrest .
Despite intravenous fluids , intravenous epinephrine , and multiple attempts at defibrillation , the patient was unable to be resuscitated .
Upon arrival of the covering access physician the patient was being ventilated mechanically and CPR was being performed .
The rhythm revealed sinus tachycardia with no palpable or measurable blood pressure .
There were also runs of ventricular tachycardia which generated into ventricular fibrillation that was refractory to multiple cardioversions .
A pericardiocentesis was attempted with no yield of pericardial fluid .
A transvenous pacing wire was attempted and a pacing rhythm was obtained but with no palpable blood pressure .
In total , the patient was defibrillated 10 times , given 5 courses of intravenous epinephrine , one course of intravenous Atropine and intravenous calcium x 1 in addition to an amp of bicarbonate .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 78-year-old woman had stage IIIB carcinoma of the cervix and she has known periaortic and splenic metastases .
She was discharged from the hospital about 18 days prior to her admission , following a month long stay .
When her cancer was diagnosed , she underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy .
She had extensive disease of the uterus , ovarian tubes , omentum and the periaortic lymph nodes .
Postoperatively , she developed ileus , then finally she recovered and she was discharged to the nursing home .
She was readmitted because of a problem with uremia and high BUN and creatinine when she seen in the office and the BUN and creatinine was ordered .
The BUN was 70 and creatinine was 4.6 and for this reason she had ultrasound of the kidney which showed bilateral hydronephrosis .
The patient was admitted to the hospital for ureteral stent placement .
On the day of admission , she was generally stable and she had no evidence of disease in the pelvis , no bleeding and no other abnormality .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Dr. Jescdrig was called and a consultation was done and he placed bilateral ureteral stents in her kidneys .
Postoperatively , she diuresed very well .
She had dropped her BUN and creatinine to normal and she was found to have may be metastatic disease to her skin on the right paraumbilical area .
Because of her age and mental condition and the fact that she had cerebral atrophy , the decision was made for comfort unless she has any further problem and no further chemotherapy or treatment will be given .
The possibility that she may need to receive radiation therapy to this area to prevent her from getting further obstruction was also brought up .
Her family felt that at the present time , because her condition was no good , they would like to just take her home so that she could enjoy the quality of life .
Indeed , at the time of discharge she was conscious and she was cooperative and she was able to communicate very nicely with everyone including her family , except for the mental instability that she had because of her cerebral atrophy due to senility .
FOLLOW-UP :
She will be followed in the Centu Fairgmer Queen Medical Center .

History of Present Illness :
This is a 39 year-old female with a history of diabetes type I on an insulin pump , anemia , hypothyroidism , gastroparesis , GERD , who was transferred from Mediplex Rehab Hospital Hospital for further management of hypoxic respiratory failure .
She arrived at Mediplex Rehab Hospital Hospital on 07-01 for 1 day of nausea and vomiting and was found to be febrile to 99 at that time .
She was admitted for likely gastroparesis and eventually had a complete fever work-up that included a negative chest x-ray , blood cultures , and urine culture .
She was discharged on 07-02 and represented that day with continued nause , vomiting , and fever .
She was readmitted and had a complete febrile work-up that included CT abdomene / pelvis , chest x-ray , blood culture 's , urine cultures , all of which were unremarkable .
She was intubated on 07-03 for progressive respiratory failure .
Workup continued to be negative .
Extubation was attempted on 07-14 , but she was re-intubated due to inspiratory stridor .
A CT neck showed soft tissue swelling obliterating the airway surrounding the ETT tube .
She was transferred to Providence Behavioral Health Hospital for further management .
Brief Hospital Course :
This is a 39 year-old female with diabetes type I , hypothyroidism , gastroparesis who was transfered for hypoxic respiratory failure .
1. Hypoxic Rspiratory Failure :
She arrived intubated and sedated from Esteban Hospital .
On arrival a chest x-ray showed perihilar and bibasilar opacities , which appeared conistent with pulmonary edema but also possibly consistent with a pneumonia .
There was no evidence of ARDS .
She was known to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum at the outside hospital .
A bronchoscopy with BAL was performed and a sputum sample eventually grew out MRSA .
She was treated with vancomycin to cover her MRSA pneumonia .
A CT scan was performed on 07-17 to evaluate the soft tissue swelling seen on CT at the outside hospital .
The CT showed increased soft tissues within the pharynx which was felt to be secondary to prolonged intubation / trauma .
She was treated with steroids for this swelling at the outside hospital , and these were continued .
It was decided that patient should receive one more trial off the vent before committing her to a tracheotomy .
She did well on minimal vent settings but it was decided to delay extubating the patient until the morning of 6/2 .
Overnight , the patient became hypoxic , dropping to the 80 's .
A chest x-ray showed that the ET tube was displaced to very high in the trachea .
The cuff was deflated and the patient was extubated .
She was placed in supplemental oxygen by shovel mask and her sats immediately improved .
She was weaned down until she was maintaining her oxygen saturation above 90% on 6L by nasal cannuala .
As she was doing well without evidence of stridor , the steroids were stopped .
She did well and was weaned from supplemental oxygen .
At the time of discharge , she was oxygenating well on room air .
She Will need to complete a 14 day course of vancomycin for her MRSA pneumonia on 2019-07-30 .
2. Enterobacter bacteremia :
She was initially covered broadly with vancomycin , ciprofloxacin , and falgyl .
She had positive blood cultures at Mediplex Rehab Hospital Hospital for gram negative rods .
Subsequently , zosyn was added .
The cultures grew out enterobacter cloacae .
It was unclear the source of her bacteremia .
Her stool cultures were negative .
Her central line was removed and the tip was culture negative .
She was transitioned to on levofloxacin for her bacteremia .
She had no positive cultures during this admission .
Once she was more stable , an abdominal CT was performed to look for an abscess .
This study was negative .
However , the study was limited due to inadequate po contrast intake by the patient ; it did show a question of a cecal cystic lesion verse normal loop of bowel .
This study will need to be repeated once she is tolerating po 's .
She will complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin for her bacteremia on 2019-07-30 .
3. Diabetes type I :
She was intially maintained on an insulin drip for tight glycemic control .
She was followed by Albano during the admission .
She was initially maintained on D5W , which was increased to D10W as the patient was persistently borderline hypoglycemic while on insulin drip .
Once she began to take PO 's , the insulin drip was stopped and patient was started on glargine with a humalog sliding scale .
While her po intake was minimal she was maintained on supplemental IV dextrose to suppress ketosis .
While she was on the IV dextrose , she required up to 26 units of glargine for glycemic control .
As she starting taking some foods , her glargine was decrease .
At the time of discharge her glargine was 10 .
Her blood glucose were under good control .
The day prior to discharge , she was nauseated and not taking pos .
Therefore , she received 1L of D5 , and her sugars were elevated to 400 the day of discharge .
4. Gastroparesis :
She has a history of gastroparesis secondary to long-standing type I diabetes .
Once she was extubated , she was nauseated with emesis .
She was intially treated with erythromycin for pro-motility as she had a bad reaction to reglan in the past .
She continued to remained nauseated so she was treated with phenergan , anzemet , zofran , and ativan .
She intermittently was able tolerate pos .
Her nausea was accompanied by abdominal pain for which she was treated with morphine .
She was transitioned to a PCA for better pain control .
She continued to have nausea despite an agressive anti-emetic regimen .
It was felt that her symptoms were secondary to gastroparesis .
However , other causes were looked for including adrenal insufficiency and bowel obstruction .
She had a normal cortisol stimulation test .
A abdominal plain film showed non-specific bowel gas patterns that may represent an early obstruction .
A NG tube was placed for decompression given the signs of early obstruction the day of transfer .
The GI service was consulted and they felt that her symptoms were all gastroparesis .
They recommended erythromycin and zelnorm .
She should eventually have a tissue transglutaminase to rule out celiac disease .
5. Transaminitis :
Per report , She had elevated LFTs at the outside hospital .
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed and was negative for any acute pathology .
Her LFTs trended down during this admission .
6. Hypothyroidism :
She was maintained on her levothyroxine .
While she was not taking adequate pos , she was on IV levothyroxine .
7. F/E/N :
She was NPO while intubated and recived tube feedings for nutrition .
After extubation , patient was started on sips and had a speech and swallow evaluation .
She was cleared to advance her diet as tolerated .
She only tolerated some clear liquids .
At the time of transfer , she was NPO given her NG tube .
8. Prophylaxis :
PPI , Heparin SQ .
9. Access :
Her central line was removed given the concern for a line infection .
She had a double lumen PICC place .
10. CODE :

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations .
After a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent .
Prior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung .
Subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent .
It was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto .
Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries .
After a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute .
Based upon these findings it was felt that Mr. State most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state .
In Hospital he was seen by both Speech Therapy , physical therapy , and the Uspend Harmemewood Medical Center Congestive Heart Failure Nurse Practitioner Program .
His Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 .
Future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures .
At a goal weight of 142 pounds , Mr. State &apos;s filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home .
The patient will be followed by Dr. State within a week of discharge and by Nieie Naebrand Freierm of the Dyathenslycha Medical Center ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : 
The patient is a 73 year old female who was transferred for cardiac catheterization after ventricular fibrillation arrest in the setting of an acute inferior myocardial infarction and a urinary tract infection . 
The patient was admitted on 3-16-93 to Diy Hospital for an E. coli urinary tract infection . 
The patient was readmitted on 3-20-93 because of fever , chills and a sudden onset of ventricular fibrillation arrest , successfully cardioverted back to rapid atrial fibrillation and finally to sinus rhythm , where an electrocardiogram then showed ST elevation in inferior leads . 
Peak CPK was 2494 with 18% MB 's . 
She required intubation for mild to moderate congestive heart failure , treated with diuretics , intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin . 
She had post-infarction angina , was transferred here for angiography and possible percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty . 
HOSPITAL COURSE : 
On 3-27-93 , patient underwent cardiac catheterization , coronary and left ventricular angiography without complications . 
Review of these angiograms demonstrated a dominant right coronary artery with a focal 50% stenosis in the mid-portion . 
The left main coronary artery was clear . 
The left anterior descending had moderate plaques with a 50% proximal stenosis of the right anterior oblique caudal view . 
The proximal diagonal D1 had a 50% stenosis . 
The circumflex had a long 30% stenosis proximally and an 80% stenosis at the origin of the second major marginal artery . 
The left ventricular angiogram showed akinesis of the posterobasal walls , severe hypokinesis of the diaphragmatic wall and trace mitral regurgitation . 
The patient was maintained on heparin anticoagulation . 
An exercise tolerance test with Thallium was to be performed in order to assess myocardial viability in the infarct zone . 
The right coronary artery lesion was complex and there was severe stenosis in the obtuse marginal 1 . 
The patient had no further angina . 
On 4-2-93 , she underwent a Persantine Thallium study . 
This showed no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes for ischemia and no angina pectoris . 
The thallium images showed a large region of persistently reduced blood flow involving the apex and inferoposterior segments of the left ventricular wall . 
This was consistent with scar . 
There was no definite perfusion abnormality in the circumflex zone . 
In view of these findings , it was elected to discharge her on her present medical program .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 74 year old female with metastatic papillary carcinoma of the thyroid who presented to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital on 4/28/93 with progressive weakness , weight loss and shortness of breath .
The patient was in a good state of health until January of 1993 when she developed a serious upper respiratory tract infection associated with weakness and fatigue .
She had also reported a weight loss of 15 pounds over the past two months .
Although her upper respiratory tract infection seemed to be resolving , her weakness persisted .
A work up begun by her internist , Dr. Brain , revealed a white blood cell count of 49,000 with 50% eosinophils .
She was admitted to Box Memorial Hospital Nursing Home for further evaluation .
Data collected there included a chest x-ray which was unremarkable .
The liver function tests showed an alkaline phosphatase of 303 , LDH 310 , SGOT 66 , albumin 2.5 .
A peripheral blood smear showed mature eosinophils in increased numbers .
Chromosomal studies were negative .
A bone scan showed increased uptake at the manubrium at the site of an old fracture , as well as in the right supraclavicular area .
A thyroid ultrasound showed an inferior thyroid mass .
This was followed by an abdominal CT which showed an enlarged spleen , a lytic lesion on the right iliac bone and a benign renal cyst .
Biopsy of the lytic lesion was consistent with metastases papillary carcinoma of the thyroid .
An upper gastrointestinal was unremarkable .
The small bowel follow through was within normal limits .
A thyroid scan revealed decreased function and displacement of the thyroid by a cold mass located inferiorly with calcifications on the right side .
A chest CT also revealed a small pulmonary nodule with a necrotic mass involving the right lung posteriorly .
The patient was subsequently referred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital under the service of Dr. Brain .
She continued to have profound weakness , a decreased appetite and weight loss .
She also developed lower extremity edema as well as left upper extremity swelling associated with increased shortness of breath on exertion .
A needle biopsy of the right thyroid nodule showed papillary thyroid carcinoma .
The patient reports no history of radiation exposure , no family history of thyroid carcinoma , no recent travels or exposure to tuberculosis .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Dr. Shatermivaet S Brain on 4/28/93 with a history of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with bone involvement and possible lung involvement .
Work up was begun for the possible myeloproliferative / myelodysplastic disorder associated with the hyper-eosinophilic syndrome .
Accordingly , an Oncology consult was called on 4/29/93 and a bone marrow aspirate biopsy was performed .
This revealed maturation of leukocytes to all stages with markedly increased eosinophilic proliferation .
A lung biopsy was performed on 4/30/93 without definitive results .
During this time the patient &apos;s coagulation status had improved with Vitamin K therapy with PTs normalizing .
ANCA serum results were negative .
ANA results were also nonsuggestive .
The patient continued to suffer from edema of the left upper extremity and a Vascular Radiology consult revealed a thrombosis of the left subclavian vein extending into the axillary vein .
There was some thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein as well .
A head CT was performed and was completely negative for any metastatic process involving the brain .
Thus , a heparin sliding scale was begun .
Meanwhile , the patient &apos;s eosinophilia was treated with a trial of prednisone .
She also developed a mild urinary tract infection which responded to Bactrim , but which was subsequently stopped because of diarrhea .
The conclusions at this time of the thyroid cytologist , as well as the bone pathologist , were that the findings were diagnostic of papillary thyroid carcinoma with pulmonary metastases .
Dr. Trial was subsequently consulted on 5/5 for surgical intervention .
On 5/6/93 the patient underwent a right thyroidectomy with sacrifice of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve as well as the right sternothyroid muscle and lower parathyroid gland .
She underwent autotransplantation of the right upper parathyroid gland , as well as repair of a right posterior membranous tracheotomy .
She was received in the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit immediately postoperatively in stable condition .
Her rate was well controlled on Digoxin .
The patient was transferred to the floor on 5/7 .
On the ward she continued a gentle diuresis as well as Solu-Medrol therapy .
Calcium levels remained 7.2 to 7.5 postoperatively .
She continued to improve with a slight hoarseness in her voice that was expected .
She continued to exhibit asymptomatic atrial fibrillation .
Anticoagulation was begun on the third postoperative day with Coumadin .
She was effectively anticoagulated with a PT in the range between 15 and 17 over a control of 10 .
She also received a Radiation Therapy consult for local control of her invasive carcinoma .
She did well on the ward and was discharged on her ninth postoperative day ."

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 63 - year-old man with a history of hypertension and prior history of atrial fibrillation secondary to hyperthyroidism who presented to an outside hospital with a history of left-sided chest pain at rest .
The patient awoke with chest pressure radiating to the right chest associated with diaphoresis .
The patient was found to have a blood pressure of 170/108 with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response to a heart rate of 140s .
The patient was rate controlled and transferred to the Stillman Infirmary for emergent cardiac catheterization .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was transferred for cardiac catheterization .
Emergent cardiac catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 45% , right dominant coronary artery system with occlusive single vessel disease of the LAD .
Multiple wires were used to attempt to cross the total occlusion , but were ultimately unsuccessful .
The patient was continued on a heparin drip for atrial fibrillation .
Cardiothoracic Surgery consultation was obtained and the patient was taken to the Operating Room on 2010-03-12 for coronary artery bypass grafting times two ; LIMA to the LAD , saphenous vein graft to the diagonal artery .
Subsequent to this , the patient was transferred to the CRSU for closer monitoring .
He was deemed to be too lethargic and sleepy to be extubated on postoperative day number zero .
The patient was extubated early on postoperative day number one without significant complication .
He remained in atrial fibrillation .
The EP Service was consulted regarding the patient 's atrial fibrillation .
This was his main issue in the postoperative course .
He was attempted on multiple different drugs including Procainamide , Diltiazem , Esmolol , Sotalol , Amiodarone .
The patient was kept therapeutically anticoagulated throughout this period .
The patient was also started on digoxin .
Ultimately , the patient was transferred to the floor and anticoagulation with Coumadin was begun .
The patient arrived on the floor with medications as follows :
Sotalol 180 mg b.i.d. , Diltiazem 90 mg q.i.d. , digoxin 0.125 mg q.d.
While the patient was awaiting therapeutic anticoagulation with Coumadin , he spontaneously converted into normal sinus rhythm .
The patient was found to have a resting heart rate of approximately 50 subsequent to this .
In consultation with the EP Service , Diltiazem was stopped .
After approximately 24 hours , the patient converted back into atrial fibrillation and Diltiazem was restarted at 60 mg q.i.d.
The patient then had one more episode where he was converted to normal sinus rhythm but this lasted only a few hours before reverting back to atrial fibrillation .
The patient was ultimately discharged on postoperative day number 16 , tolerating a regular diet , and adequate pain control on p.o. pain medications , having no anginal symptoms and with an INR of 2.0 .
The patient failed multiple attempts at cardioversion ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65 year old Portuguese male with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction i May 1993 and is status post a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the LAD who presented on 10-24-93 with crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .
He had no prior cardiac history until May 1993 when on 5-24 he had crushing chest pain which radiated to his left arm .
He was found at that time to have 3-4 mm ST segment elevations in V1 through V4 at Pre Health .
The patient was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and had 4-7 mm ST segment elevations across the precordium with Q&apos;s in V1 and V2 , 2 mm ST elevation in AVL , and 1-2 mm reciprocal ST depression in II , III , and F.
On physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab .
The cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of 29/16 , RV 33/8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 .
He had a 95% proximal left anterior descending lesion which was PTCA &apos;d to a residual of 30% and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .
He also had some mild to moderate disease at the OM1 noted at that time .
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a peak CPK of 5,042 and 26.7% MB&apos;s .
His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems .
He had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started .
On day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis .
On day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with Thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in II , III , and AVF , and 1.5 mm downsloping ST depressions in V5 and V6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on Thallium .
Therefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal PDA lesion and a circumflex lesion after the OM .
The patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Shuffburle of Gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Amesin of Cardiology and Dr. Shuffpasc of Dingclearf Alllirefaith Memorial Hospital .
However , he did not keep any of these appointments .
He went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months .
On the a.m. of 10-24-93 , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .
He came to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward where he was noted to be ashen and diaphoretic .
He was treated with oxygen , aspirin , five sublingual nitroglycerins , heparin , and was eventually made pain free with that regimen .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
His cardiac risk factors included hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , and a positive family history .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit for a rule out MI protocol .
He was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin .
No beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110/70 .
The patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 219 and 20.9% MB fraction .
This was a non-Q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .
on 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been PTCA &apos;d , a lesion in the first OM , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the OM3 .
The left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle .
Given the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the PTCA , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient .
He was ambulated progressively on the floor .
A beta blocker was started with Metoprolol initially at 25 mg PO bid and eventually increased to 50 mg PO bid .
The patient ambulated extensively on the FIH 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath .
On 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with Thallium imaging .
This treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment .
The patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade .
There were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm ST depression in II , III , and AVF .
The study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain .
Thallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle .
There was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test .
These images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous Thallium images in May 1993 .
After extensive discussion between myself , Dr. Amesin , and Dr. Scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management .
The patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future .
Dr. Amesin had a long discussion with the patient &apos;s daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient &apos;s compliance .
Previously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments .
The importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient .
She will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with Dr. Amesin as well as Dr. Lfsquarc on the outside .
The patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization .
Despite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done .
He will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future .

History of Present Illness :
This is an 85 year old female with prior history of non-hodgkins lymphoma , s/p Cytoxan in 2003 a with recurrence in 2009 .
Follow up examinations have found a suspicious left lower lobe finding .
Cardiac workup prior to left lower lobe resection led to cardiac catheterization which found severe three vessel disease with 04-05+ mitral regurgitation .
She now present for surgical intervention .
Brief Hospital Course :
Mrs. Mandelbaum was admitted and underwent three vessel coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. Larry Mckinney .
Of note , intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram evaluation showed only mild mitral regurgitation , so no repair/replacement was indicated .
Following the operation , she was brought to the CSRU .
On postoperative day one , she was noted to be largely unresponsive with left hemiparesis .
Restlessness with body tremors were also noted .
A stat MRI was notable for multiple abnormal foci consistent with systemic emboli .
These were found in the right cerebellar , occipital and anterior parietal lobes .
The neurology service was consulted and attributed these findings to cholesterol emboli .
Due to seizure activity , Dilantin was started .
Anticoagulation was not recommended .
Over the next several days , her neurological status slowly improved .
She was eventually extubated without incident .
She went on to experience paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which was initially treated with intravenous Amiodarone .
She concomitantly had loose stools which were C. diff negative .
Her clinical status stablized and she transferred to the step down unit on postoperative day six .
She remained mostly in a normal sinus rhythm and transitioned to oral Amiodarone which will need to continue for three months postop .
She tolerated beta blockade which was slowly advanced as tolerated .
She worked daily with physical and occupational therapy .
Her neurological status continued to improve .
Acyclovir was eventually increased from her maintenance dose for a herpes zoster breakout on her right upper back .
In addition , she was empirically started on Flagyl for persistent diarrhea ( despite negative C. diff cultures ) , however she developed an additional rash on her buttocks after the first dose of flagyl , so the flagyl was discontinued .
She developed a urinary tract infection for which she was started on Bactrim .
A foley catheter was inserted given her mutiple episodes of incontinence that were adding to skin irritation .
On insertion she was found to be retaining 1400 cc of urine , so the foley catheter was left in .
She continued to make clinical improvements and was cleared for discharge to rehab on postoperative day 10 ."

Mr. Villesatelkscurb is a fifty year old black gentleman with a long history of hepatitis C , believed to be contracted during transfusions in a previous trauma .
The patient had recently prior to this admission , had a rise in his alpha feta protein and a biopsy of his liver had shown hepatocellular carcinoma .
The patient was admitted for liver transplant workup and to await liver transplant .
PAST MEDICAL and
SURGICAL HISTORY :
Significant for motor vehicle accident in 1966 , requiring exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy , tonsillectomy as a child , pneumonia in the past , hepatitis C and recent diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma .
ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
no known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
On admission medications included Lasix and iron .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Preoperatively , the patient underwent chemo-embolization for his hepatocellular carcinoma .
The remainder of his preoperative course was benign .
On July 15 , 1992 , a liver became available , and the patient underwent hepatectomy and orthotopic liver transplant .
His operation was complicated by severe coagulopathy requiring fifty-nine units of packed red blood cells , 64 units of FFP and 34 units of platelets .
Postoperatively , the patient continued to have a coagulopathy requiring re-exploration on postoperatively day 2 , with findings only of hematoma and no active bleeding .
Initially , the patient did well in the Intensive Care Unit , mentally alert , and oriented , however , he continued to be coagulopathic and was requiring large amounts of blood and FFP transfusions , with a resultant pulmonary edema .
He developed renal failure felt to be ATN secondary to ischemia of his kidneys .
The patient remained intubated in the Intensive Care Unit for twelve days prior to his death .
He had daily transfusions of FFP and blood , and continued coagulopathy .
He also developed thrombocytopenia , requiring persistent platelet transfusions on a daily basis .
His immunosuppression was OKT3 and Solu Medrol , and he underwent hemodialysis and ultra filtration to remove fluid .
While in the ICU he developed seizures , requiring large amounts of intravenous Valium to break his seizures , and he was maintained on Tegretol and Dilantin .
However , he became progressively more mentally obtunded .
During the seizure , he bit his tongue , resulting in a large bleed from his tongue , which was sutured by the ENT Service , however , his continued coagulopathy resulted in bleeding from his nasopharynx , which could never be identified , and also upper gastrointestinal bleeding .
Endoscopy never revealed specific sources of bleeding , although he appeared to have a diffuse duodenitis .
He was started on Pitressin to try to control the gastrointestinal bleeding , but he continued to have severe bleeding , and became progressively hypotensive , with eventual bradycardia and cardiac arrest .
He was pronounced dead at 3:49 PM on July 27 , 1992 ."

The patient woke up as usual on May 8 , 1995 .
At 8 a.m. the patient was looking at his wife with the background outside a large window .
The patient had sudden onset of blurred vision , where the right side of his wife &apos;s face looked blurred .
The patient did not notice change of vision in the background .
The blurred vision was homonymous , which he had blurred in each eye in the left visual field .
The same blurred vision was also noticed later when the patient was watching television and also when he was reading .
The patient was seen at the Ochtuheihugh Put University Medical Center and then he was referred to the Purckecation Balpoingdelt Pabarnes- Campa Memorial Hospital .
At 8 p.m. the patient seen at the Purckecation Balpoingdelt Pabarnes- Campa Memorial Hospital and was examined and assessed .
The patient was referred to Ph University Of Medical Center for rule out transient ischemic attack and rule out stroke .
The patient denies any nausea , vomiting , ataxia , motor deficits , speech deficits or sensory deficits .
The patient lightly bumped his head on the top three times on the previous night and the patient had frontal headaches and a tight neck .
One hour after he had physical activity on the previously night as well .
ALLERGIES :
The patient denies any drug allergies .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a right occipital cerebral infarction .
The patient was started on intravenous heparin and had the studies as described above for rule out source of embolic strokes including carotid noninvasives , transcranial Dopplers , Holter electrocardiogram and echocardiogram .
The patient also had serial electrocardiogram , which showed no change .
The patient also had serial creatinine kinase with MB fractions studied , which revealed MB fraction too low to be tested .
The patient also experienced a feeling of moving back and forth when lying down with neck extended during the magnetic resonance imaging study and also in bed .
This moving sense , with normal electroencephalogram , was thought to be a mild vestibular dysfunction or from the acute episode of the stroke .
The patient will have these symptoms only when the eyes are closed .
Our opinion was not to intervene or have any further studies for acute period and to continued to observe .
The patient did have a hypotensive episode and the systolic blood pressure was 80 , after the patient received his regular cardiac medications .
The patient had been off his regular medications since during the admission and will be discharged off his medications .
Otherwise , there were no further episodes of blurred vision .
The patient was stable with an unchanged neurological and physical examination and was discharged on aspirin 325 mg po qd , on May 14 , 1995 .
The patient will be randomized on the Wars study early next week by the Stroke Service at Ph University Of Medical Center ."

Trauma Surgery
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 25 - year-old gentleman who is status post a motor vehicle accident in which he was the unrestrained driver and struck a telephone pole .
He was ejected from the car and landed on his face .
Extreme damage was reported to the vehicle by first responders .
It was presumed high-speed motor vehicle collision .
The patient was CMED-flighted to Quincy Medical Center , and he was intubated upon arrival in the Emergency Department .
After initial trauma assessment and initiation of resuscitation , a CT scan was performed .
Images of his head , abdomen , and thorax were obtained .
His injuries included bilateral zygomal and orbital rim fractures , a right temporal fracture , bilateral frontal contusions , and a right temporal epidural versus subdural hematoma .
The anterior and posterior of the frontal sinus was fractured with communication with the ethmoid air cells , presumably caused air in the orbit .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
1. NEUROLOGY :
Mr. Roach was transported to Intensive Care Unit from the trauma bay .
Upon arrival , Neurosurgery promptly placed V. Holtzen bolt .
This allowed continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure .
Notably , intracranial pressure was 17 when the bolt was placed .
During his hospitalization , his intracranial pressure was monitored very closely and maintained to a level of less than 20 .
To do this , mannitol 25 mg q. 6h. was used .
While using mannitol , his serum osmolalities were followed closely .
In addition , to monitoring his intracranial pressure , his systemic blood pressures were maintained in such a manner that his cerebral perfusion pressure was maintained at 70 mmHg .
A parameter monitor for his neurologic status PaCO2 which was maintained between 35 and 40 during his hospitalization .
Mr. Roach was kept sedated with propofol and was given Fentanyl and / or morphine boluses for pain .
Neurologic checks were followed initially every one hour and then every two hours to monitor for change in neurologic examination .
During his hospitalization , two subsequent CAT scans were obtained ; one on hospital day two .
This CAT scan revealed possible worsening and was read as epidural versus subdural bleed .
After a discussion with both Radiology and Neurosurgery , the decision was made that the worsening did not appear significant , and this was not accompanied by a change in his clinical condition .
His intracranial pressure remained stable , and his clinical examination was unchanged .
An additional CT scan was obtained on hospital day three .
This examination was unchanged from the previous examination .
Again , his intracranial pressure and neurologic examination remained the same , and conservative treatment was opted for .
2. CARDIOVASCULAR :
As described in previous section , Neo-Synephrine and eventually Levophed were used to maintain a coronary perfusion pressure of greater than 70 .
A pulmonary artery catheter was placed on hospital day four .
This catheter was placed when the patient started to demonstrate septic physiology and for increasing pressor support .
Please see Infectious Disease section for more details .
3. GASTROINTESTINAL :
Mr. Roach was n.p.o. from the time of his admission .
A orogastric tube was passed .
Initially during admission , carafate was given down the orogastric tube .
However , on a routine chest x-ray shot on hospital day three , a mediastinum was noted .
This raised the question of potential esophageal rupture .
Gastroenterology was consulted for this .
Gastroenterology was consulted to assist in creating the most appropriate diagnostic rhythm given his intubated and sedated status .
At this point , his carafate was switched to intravenous Protonix and he was strictly n.p.o.
4. HEMATOLOGY :
Throughout Mr. Richard admission , his hematocrit remained stable in the low 30s .
As will be discussed in the Infectious Disease section , he developed an episode of what appeared to be sepsis , and his white blood cell count peaked at 23 .
Mr. Roach was on Pneumo boots spontaneous compression devices for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis .
He was not a candidate for subcutaneous heparin as we were concerned of an intracranial hemorrhage .
An inferior vena cava filter was considered but was deferred , as it was felt that Mr. Roach was too unstable to undergo the procedure .
5. ENDOCRINE :
Mr. Marian blood sugar was maintained under tight control from 100 to 130 using a regular insulin sliding-scale .
6. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
Mr. Roach had a spike in white blood cell count and developed fevers .
His blood urine and sputum were all cultured .
Blood cultures were pertinent for one bottle of gram - positive coagulase - negative Staphylococcus which grew from 08-25 .
His preliminary cultures including sputum from 08-25 grew Escherichia coli .
Sputum from 08-27 grew gram-negative rods , not yet speciated , and from 08-27 a bronchoalveolar lavage grew 1+ gram-negative rods and 4+ polymorphonuclear lymphocytes .
Throughout this time , Mr. Richard temperature continued to increase and was such that on hospital day four , his temperature maximum was 42.2 degrees centigrade .
During his hospitalization , his was treated with vancomycin for his gram-negative rods , imipenem , and Flagyl .
Initially , he had been placed on clindamycin to cover his drain , but his cultures became positive , and his white blood cell count increased .
He was switched from clindamycin to the imipenem and Flagyl .
Vancomycin was added when we had the positive blood culture .
With a fever of 102 , up to 42 degrees centigrade , aggressive measures including cooling blankets , alcohol swabs , and fans were used in an attempt to bring his body temperature down .
Hypercarbia would result and increase in cerebral perfusion , paralysis was initiated to decrease genesis of carbon dioxide secreted during shivering .
7. PULMONARY :
As discussed in the Infectious Disease section , Mr. Roach developed a pneumonia likely from gram-negative organisms , but most likely from Escherichia coli .
For this pneumonia , he was placed empirically on imipenem , vancomycin , and Flagyl .
On hospital day three , Mr. Roach had developed an episode of tachycardia and tachypnea .
For this , a CT angiogram was obtained which demonstrated no pulmonary embolism .
On hospital day four , a routine chest x-ray revealed a left-sided pneumothorax .
For this , a left #34 Caucasian chest tube was placed .
On the evening of hospital day four , Mr. Roach had an acute episode whereby his central venous pressure rose sharply and immediately followed by a period of asystole .
Urgent resuscitation measures were initiated .
The measures included attempts at pacing .
Epinephrine and atropine were administered as were bicarbonate and calcium .
He had a differential diagnosis of asystole preceded by an acute rise in central venous pressure included attention pneumothorax , cardiac tamponade , and pulmonary embolism .
During the resuscitation afterwards , it was noted that a patent left chest tube was present in the left chest , so initially neo-decompression was attempted in the right chest .
There was no sign of attention pneumothorax with decompression , and a right chest tube was placed .
During this time , a needle aspiration of what was felt to be the pericardium was performed revealing bloody fluid coming back .
A left anterior thoracotomy was made by the Cardiac Surgery fellow who was present .
After 30 minutes of active resuscitation including internal cardiac massage , there was no evidence of return of vital signs or electric activity to the heart as noted on electrocardiogram monitors .
Resuscitation was terminated at 1914 on 08-27 .
After the termination of resuscitation , both the anesthesia Intensive Care Unit attending and the surgical attending were present to discuss the proceedings events with the patient 's family members including his next of kin , his mother .
Permission for a postmortem examination was granted .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula .
The patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .
She did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .
This may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .
Bronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .
She underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .
She had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .
A bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .
She has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .
A barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .
Findings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .
Esophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .
Her steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .
She then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .
The pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .
She remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
The patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
On postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .
An endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .
She received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .
The patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .
A repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .
A pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .
She remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .
Her chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .
She suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .
Her steroids were weaned .
Because of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .
She remained in a coma .
The blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .
Her sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .
The urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .
On March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .
There was a large left pleural effusion however .
This was drained with a left chest tube .
Her sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .
She developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .
On March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .
She was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .
On March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .
Attempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .
This was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .
She continued to require pressor support in the high 30 &apos;s .
She also fell into a coma once again .
On March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .
On April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .
Discussions were held with the patient &apos;s family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .
She had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .
Decision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .
The patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .
Her respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Stain was transferred from the Oreiewlefell Merkane I Penaltbridgesgreat University Medical Center for progressive respiratory failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome superimposed on a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , perhaps asthma , and ulcerative colitis .
His only positive result was a sputum culture for Pseudomonas and this came after he had already been on antibiotics .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Wire who felt that manipulation of the tracheal tube was the best approach to the air leak since it was a new trach and he was requiring such high ventilator support that it was risky to change it .
He also felt that lung biopsy at this time was rather risky .
The patient was therefore completely cultured again and begun on antibiotic coverage which would take care of the Pseudomonas he was known to have .
The steroids were tapered .
He was also begun on anti-Candida regimen for his urinary tract infection with yeast being seen .
Because of the story of hemoptysis , he also underwent an exotic bleeding work up for such things as Wegner &apos;s and Goodpasture &apos;s .
These results were all negative .
He continued to require very high FIO2 .
He was found to have a DVT by ultrasound .
He underwent a trial of TPA followed by heparin .
This produced substantially further hemoptysis and the need for transfusion .
He stabilized from this , but on the fifth while continuing to have extremely ventilator requirement .
In consultation with his family , it was decided that enough support had been done .
At that time , therefore , ventilator support was withdrawn under the comfort measures of morphine .

Brief Hospital Course :
BRIEF OVERVIEW :
57 yo F with h/o polyglandular autoimmune syndrome initially admitted in May to FICU for suicide overdose then transferred to Whittier Rehab Hospital 4 for depression , who was transferred to the medical floor for a syncopal episode and hypotension to 60 systolic that returned to baseline with 2.5L IVF who was subsequently transferred to the CMED CSRU for a recurrent episode of hypotension , fevers and concern for sepsis .
Initially when she arrived to the floor she was afebrile , normotensive without signs of orthostasis , had a negative UA , a clear chest xray and no signs / symptoms of a fever .
She was slightly tachycardic .
She was initially not started on antibiotics .
She was given a standing IVF order .
Overnight she became febrile to 102.3 , increasingly tachycardic to 125 , and hypotensive to 80 systolic .
She was started on stress dose steroids and levo , flagyl , and vanco .
She was given 4L of fluid boluses and transfered to the CMED CSRU .
In the CMED CSRU , repeated attempts to place lines were unsuccessful .
The above treatments were continued .
Urine cultures returned with 10-100,000 organisms coag negative staph .
Blood cultures remained negative .
Vital signs stabilized and she was transfered back to the medical floor after 2 days in the ICU .
Stress dose steroids were planned for a 7 day course , antibiotics were peeled back to levofloxacin alone , and a R hip film revealed no loosening nor inflammation .
Echo showed normal function , trace AR , and no MR .
She had a normal RUQ US , as well .
On the floor the patient remained stable hemodynamically without recurrent fever and was stable for transfer back to Franciscan Children 's Hospital & Rehab Center 4 .
At the time of discharge , her potassium had been low despite repletion , Na was elevated , as was blood pressure .
On recommendation from endocrine , her fludrocortisone was decreased from 0.2 to 0.1 ( higher than required doses of fludrocort can cause these symptoms . ) .
1. Hypotension :
Patient presented after episode of hypotension and syncope on Mass. Mental Health Center 5 .
Initially it was felt that this was a result of poor PO intake .
She was afebrile without orthostatic vital signs nor hypotension .
She had no symptoms of infectious source , normal UA , normal chest xray , and no symptoms nor signs of injury after her fall with syncope .
Neuro exam was normal .
Subsequently overnight , she developed a fever to 102.3 and recurrent hypotension in the setting of fevers and tachycardia that was concerning for an infectious source .
She still had no localizing signs of infection and culture data was negative to be negative .
RUQ US was ordered and returned without signs of infection later .
She was started on stress dose steroids .
She had cultures drawn , was given tylenol ( tylenol screen prior to this dose was negative , as was a urine tox ) , was started on levofloxacin , metronidazole , and vancomycin to cover emperically for hospital aquired pneumonia , GI sources , and a potential hip infection .
Her transaminases were slightly elevated , which was later attributed to shock liver as a result of her period of hypotension .
Lipase and amylase remained normal .
In the ICU she also received an echo that revealed normal function and little valvular disease ( she has two loud systolic murmurs on exam ) , and a hip film revealing no inflammation nor loosening .
Urine culture twice grew 10-100,000 coag negative staph .
A line could not be placed for technical reasons , however after 4L NS on the floor and 01-30 more in the ICU via peripheral IV 's she was stable .
She remained hemodynamically stable with good UOP in the setting of being started on abx and stress dose steroids .
The steroids were thought to have helped significantly in in the setting of Addison 's with possibely superimposed infection .
The patient was planned for a 7 day course of stress dose steroids followed by a return to her basal predinisone / fludrocortisone dose .
2. Elevated LFTs :
LFTs wre elevated at presentation .
Initially the differential was thought to include shock liver from hypotension , hepatitis , cholangitis or choledocholithiasis .
Hepatitis serologies were negative and the pt was eventually felt to have had shock liver from her hypotensive episode as the transaminitis resolved over time .
3. Hypoparathyroidism :
This is a chronic problem .
calcium levels were followed with a goal to keep them around 8.0 by continuing Calcium carbonate , calcitriol .
The pt required calcium gluconate x1 the day prior to discharge .
Per endocrine at the time of discharge , the pt may need an increase in calcium PO , but at this time they recommended no change .
It will need to be monitored over time .
4. Addison 's- The patient is on basal prednisone / fludrocortisone .
These were initially continued as above and later , when she became hypotensive and febrile , stress dose steroids were started and planned for a 7 day course followed by a return to her prior dose of prednisone .
At the time of discharge , her potassium had been low despite repletion ,
Na was elevated , as was blood pressure .
On recommendation from endocrine , her fludrocortisone was decreased from 0.2 to 0.1 ( higher than required doses of fludrocort can cause these symptoms. ) .
5. DM :
Light followed the patient .
She was continued on her prior dose of steroids with sliding scale per patient using a 1:15 carb counting scheme with a 1:30 correction factor .
On the day of discharge her glargine was decreased by one unit because her glucose remained somewhat low in the mornings .
6. R Hip pain :
Later in her hospital course , the pt complained of hip pain .
A R hip film was negative for pathology or failure of her hip replacement .
Pain was controlled with tylenol and the pt was reassured .
PT was consulted .
The pt uses a wheelchair often at baseline due to pain from arthritis .
7. Depression :
The pt was being treated at Mediplex Rehab Hospital 4 for suicidal ideation and a suicide attempt on original admission with tylenol and oxycodone .
She had planned this attempt carefully without the knowledge of those close to her and very much expected her attempt to work .
She had been depressed for some time but her loved ones were very surprised at her attempt .
She remained very depressed at her inpatient admission and refractory to treatment .
One day prior to her transfer to the medical floor she was sectioned to initiate ECT , which she had previously refused .
As a result , she was maintained on her ativan , mirtazapine , risperidone , duloxetine .
She did not exhibit psychotic symptoms .
She had a 1:1 sitter at all times .
She denied any suicidality but did endorse depression .
She denied HI , SI , and illusions / hallucinations .
Her mood appeared stable throughout her hospitalization .
She was followed by psychiatry in consultation while she was on the medical floor .
The patient did have heparin subcutaneously while on the medical floor and in the ICU .
She remained full code throughout the hospitalization .
As on prior hospitalization , her HCP was shared by Dianne White ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 52-year-old right handed male with a many year history of bilateral shoulder pain , right greater than left .
He has steroid injections in the right and in the left four times .
Arthrogram in the distant past showed a right rotator cuff tear and he now has increased pain in his left shoulder .
MRI by report showed bilateral rotator cuff repairs and he was admitted for repair of the left rotator cuff .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with the assessment of left rotator cuff repair and he was taken to the Operating Room on the day of admission where he underwent left rotator cuff repair under general endotracheal tube anesthesia .
There were no intraoperative complications .
His postoperative course was generally unremarkable except for a prolonged course of advancement with range of motion of his left shoulder .
Occupational therapy became involved initially and he remained on patient controlled analgesia secondary to problems with left shoulder pain .
He was kept in the hospital for an extended period to improve his postoperative range of motion .
However , he was eventually able to achieve forward flexion of 135 degrees and external rotation of 30 degrees by postoperative day number eight .
His wound remained clean and dry and showed no signs of infection and healed well .
However , his course was otherwise complicated by discovery of persistently elevated blood sugars and Endocrinology was consulted to rule out possible newly diagnosed diabetes .
His hemoglobin A1C levels actually came back within normal limits , however , the wide excursions of his sugars were consistent with possible diabetes .
He was placed on a diabetic diet and his sugars did show some improvement .
It was not necessary to start him on oral hypoglycemics or insulin .
He also complained of occasional spells and jitteriness and some orthostatic dizziness and thus Neurology was consulted and EMG &apos;s were performed which were normal .
His neurologist was contacted , Dr. Cap , and the exact of his problems was not demonstrated during this hospitalization , however , they felt that this could possibly be an autonomic type neuropathy maybe secondary to some underlying diabetic process .
Further work-up of his neurologic conditions were planned as an outpatient .
Thus , he was discharged on postoperative day number eight in good condition with a well healed left shoulder wound and doing well with occupational therapy with plans for him to follow-up with Dr. Necessary ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Prehekote is an 88-year-old Portuguese speaking only male who was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate in 1998 .
He received transurethral resection of the prostate one year ago because of persistent urinary retention .
After that , he was on Lupron and Nilandron hormone therapy .
The patient was admitted on February 23 , 1999 to Eifro Medical Center because of failure to thrive and decreased hematocrit .
He was noted to have elevated BUN and creatinine .
BUN was 34 and creatinine was 2.6 , up from his baseline of 1.0 .
Prostate specific antigen increased from 77.9 to 88 , and the patient also had urinary incontinence and body weight loss .
Further evaluation of his renal failure showed that the patient has bilateral hydronephrosis , most likely obstructive uropathy due to prostate CA in the pelvic area .
Because of the increasing creatinine to 8.0 on February 28 , 1999 , a left nephrostomy tube was placed .
However after the procedure , the patient &apos;s hematocrit dropped to 24 and he was transfused two units of packed red blood cells .
His hematocrit increased to about 30 , but he continued to have hematuria and his renal function only improved very slowly .
He also received Kayexalate for hyperkalemia .
Due to the persistent blood in the urine , he was transferred from Eifro Medical Center to the Retelk County Medical Center for angiographic studies to rule out any vascular injuries .
The patient was transferred to Genearocktemp Ry Health on March 3 , 1999 .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
The patient had constipation with dysuria , but no fever or chills .
No cough .
No chest pain .
No palpitations , history of epigastric pain and body weight loss .
No headache .
No bone pain .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
After admission , urology , nephrology as well as interventional radiology was consulted about the management of this patient .
The specialist concluded that because the patient &apos;s hematuria seemed to be stable and hematocrit to maintain at about 29-30 , there is no urgent need to do an arteriogram which may cause further damage to the patient &apos;s kidney .
Urology consultation thinks that cystoscopy would not add any benefit to the management and only would consider a right nephrostomy if renal function failed to improve .
After admission , the patient was treated conservatively to correct his electrolyte and metabolic acidosis .
He was given blood transfusion , two units when his hematocrit dropped to 29.4 .
After transfusion , the patient &apos;s hematocrit rose to 37.7 on the day of discharge .
The patient was also given sodium bicarbonate to correct his metabolic acidosis .
He continued to pass about 1500-2000 cc of urine a day and his renal function improved slowly with creatinine decreased to 4.2 on the day of discharge .
During this admission , the patient also developed atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of about 70-80 .
CPK was tracked , but was totally normal .
No beta blockers were given .
A long discussion amongst the specialist , nephrology , urology , interventional radiology , primary oncology as well with the family lead to the conclusion that conservative management may give the patient more comfort than crisis treatment in this well advanced prostate CA .
Dr. Lucreamull discussed the patient &apos;s clinical status and overall situation with the patient &apos;s family and the family decided that Mr. Prehekote could return home with hospice .
The patient &apos;s primary care physician , Dr. Tomedankell Flowayles will manage the hospice issues .
The patient was discharged to home for hospice on March 8 , 1999 ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 74-year-old woman , well known to the cardiac surgery service , readmitted from Glasmif/putdi Health Network with sternal wound infection .
She has been previously hospitalized on 12 April 1998 for the same diagnosis .
She is now coming for surgical treatment , wound debridement , and possible wound closure with bilateral pectoralis flap .
She underwent coronary artery bypass graft times two with saphenous vein graft on 29 March 1998 .
Of note , the patient is status post lymphoma with treatment of chemotherapy and radiation six years ago , and is an insulin-dependent diabetic .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was placed on IV antibiotics , Ancef 1 gm q.8h.
On 10 May 1998 , she underwent sternal wound debridement and closure , performed by Dr. Falccouette and Dr. Shuffzeln .
The patient was switched to ampicillin , gentamicin , and clindamycin , according to the culture , Enterococci and Staphylococcus in the wound .
Due to the persistent fevers , the patient underwent vancomycin desensitization in the surgical Intensive Care Unit followed by a change of antibiotics to vancomycin and levofloxacin .
Further cultures from sputum and urine revealed yeast sensitive to Diflucan , which was administered shortly after .
Because of expected long term antibiotic administration , a PICC line was placed and the patient was prepared for transfer back to Fo Hospital .
As a small complication , the patient opened a left ankle wound post saphenous vein harvest , which persists up until now and is of a size 2 x 1 cm .
Due to difficult ambulation , the patient developed a small ulcer in the sacral area , which was treated with Duoderm dressing .
During the course of hospitalization , the patient was followed by cardiac surgery , cardiology , infectious disease , allergy , and medicine , including GI teams ."

Patient has a history for terrible vasculopathy s/p recent right BKA with dry gangrene of the distal stump .
Patient 's last admission was significant for a negative ex-lap .
Post-operatively , his course was complicated by respiratory distress necessitating an urgent return to the ICU and was intubated .
After multuple failed attempts at extubation , the patient was trached .
Patient then did well on a trach mask and was transferred to rehab on the day of admission but now returns with tachycardia to the 120 's , and fever to 102 degrees F .
Brief Hospital Course :
The patient was re-admitted to the surgical service and taken to the CMED .
A chest x-ray on admission showed effusions consistent with CHF along with overlying pnumonia .
Urine cultures were significant for Klebsiella UTI and sputum cultures were significant for MRSA .
He was placed on vancomycin , levofloxacin and fluconazole .
He underwent PICC line placement on 06-18 .
A trach collar was placed on 06-19 .
GI was consulted for colonoscopy .
Patient was transferred to the floor on 06-20 .
He was seen by respiratory therapy and suctioned continually throughout his hospital course .
His respiratory status improved .
He tolerated his trach collar , and tube feeds at goal .
The fluconazole was discontinued .
On 06-21 the patient was seen by physical therapy .
A nutrition consult was obtained on 06-22 .
He underwent a failed bedside swallow study .
Based on a chest x-ray that showed a small hydro-pneumothorax on the left lower lobe of the lung , a thoracic surgery consult was obtained , though no specific interventions were warranted at the time .
On 06-23 the patient 's tube feed were changed from Respalor to Deliver 2.0 to give increased calories .
On 06-25 , urine cultures grew out VRE , and a C diff was negative .
He experienced low grade fevers .
He was pan-cultured on 06-26 for continued fevers .
On 06-27 , his nutrition regimen was changed to Deliver 2.0 at 70 cc / hr with 15 g ProMod .
On 06-28 , the patient experienced PVC 's .
An EKG showed ST segment depression along the lateral pre-cordial leads .
Serial enzymes showed mild elevation of troponins .
A cardiology consult was obtained .
The cardiology service simply recommended increasing the beta-blockade and maximizing the patient 's electrolyte status .
On 06-29 , the patient was transferred to the medical service .
Pt 's vancomycin was stopped after 14 days of treatment .
HIV test was found to be negative .
MRI head was obtained to further w/u patient 's apparent cognitive decline .
MRI showed prominent sulci and enlarged ventricles abnormal for the patient 's age .
Due to concerns for dementia , neurology consult was obtained .
Neurology felt that the patient 's cognitive symptoms were consistent w/ metabolic encephalopathy due to his multiple medical problems .
They felt that his mental status would improve as his health improved .
Underlying dementia was possible but difficult to assess with an overlying delerium .
The patient continued to pull out his doboff tube .
Pt had EGD performed to evaluate his poor nutritional status .
He was found to have a large gastric ulcer and high dose PPI was started .
The gastric biopsy and the serology were both negative for H. pylori .
PEG placement was unsuccessful by GI due to the patient 's anantomy .
07-05 the patient had a J tube placed in interventional radiology for nutritional support .
He was re-started on tube feeds .
07-06 patient failed a repeat swallow evaluation due to discoordinated swallow .
07-07 the patient was taken for colonoscopy and found to have a normal colon to cecum .
07-12 the patient was found to be C diff positive and was started on 14 day course of Flagyl .
On 07-18 , as his mental status improved , he did well at the bed side swall evaluation .
On 07-19 , he underwent video swallow evaluation and was able to tolerate ground consistent food and thin liquids .
His meds should be crushed and mixed with puree thick liquid .
He has gained 30 lb since the tubefeed was initiated ( 70 lb to 100 lb ) during this admission .
He will still need to be on tubefeed to support his nutrition until he is cleared by a nutritionist .
In terms of his mental status , he continued to improve steadily over the last few weeks of his hospital stay .
He was more alert and engaged with activity .
He did much better with PT and OT at the end after his mental status improved .
As noted above , his mental status change was likely toxic-metabolic from acute infection .
He started to develop more pain around the right stump since 07-17 .
He was seen by the vascular surgery who felt that he is too medically sick and malnourished to have surgery at this time .
He will follow up with Dr. Javier as outpatient .
Initially , his pain was controlled with titrating up the Oxycontin .
However , it was titrated too quickly from 10 mg bid to 30 mg bid .
He then developed urinary retention requiring foley placement .
After he passed the video swallowing , he was tolerating ground consistent solids .
On 07-24 , he had an emesis x 1 , and had aspiration pneumonia ( + interstital markings on the left on CXR , fever , leukocytosis ) .
His Flagyl course was extended , and Vanc / Levo were added .
His sputum showed many GPC which later grew Staph aureus .
Given his recent MRSA pneumonia , he will be treated with 2 week course of Vanc / Levo / Flagyl .
He was seen by the pain service who recommended to discontinue Oxycontin , and start Neurontin , MSIR , and lidocaine patch in addition to the standing Tylenol .
On 07-25 , his J-tube was noted to be obstructed but was able to be flushed by IR on 07-26 .
Tubefeed was resumed without any difficulty since .
Since oxycontin was discontinued , the foley was removed on 07-27 and was able to void without any difficulty ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : 
Ms. Lenkpruskihkooglekih is a 63-year-old lady with a history of frequent premature ventricular contractions and infrequent short runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia ( one four-beat run ) in 1991 , for which several antiarrhythmic agents including Propranolol , Quinidine , Procainamide , Tenormin , Norpace , Corgard , and Flecainide were used , but were stopped because of intolerance . 
At that time , she had clear coronary arteries on coronary angiography and an ejection fraction greater than 50% . 
She did well off antiarrhythmic agents until October of this year when she was noted to have atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate after several days of decreased exercise tolerance . 
She was started on Coumadin and had a failed attempt at DC electrical cardioversion on 11/16/96 . 
She has been on Coumadin since and has continued to have occasional palpitations and mild shortness of breath . 
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT : 
The patient was started on Propafenone 300 mg three times a day and underwent an attempt at electrical cardioversion after seven doses of this . 
This failed , despite one shock at 300 joules and two shocks at 360 joules . 
The Propafenone was stopped , and the patient was changed to Amiodarone 400 mg t.i.d. , which was continued for two days . 
The patient was discharged to home on Amiodarone 200 mg daily on 12/29/96 . 
An electrocardiogram showed no evidence of QT prolongation prior to discharge , and pulmonary function tests will be performed before the patient goes home today . 
The patient will follow up with Dr. Ther Ludzjesc at Shiekeu Hospital Medical Centers in Connecticut . 
In addition , she will return to this hospital in early February for repeat attempt at electrical cardioversion on Amiodarone . 
She will continue her Coumadin until then and arrangements for her readmission can be made through Dr. Iceca Rhaltkaaispehbreun 's office here .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 84 year old male , with a history of hypertension , who was discovered to have an asymptomatic 7 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm on CT scan obtained in the emergency room back in May .
At that time he had presented with abdominal pain , and was found to have acute cholecystectomy .
He underwent an uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy .
He presents at this time for endovascular repair of this abdominal aortic aneurysm .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Vascular Surgery Service as a same day admission , and taken to the operating room for an uncomplicated endovascular repair of his abdominal aortic aneurysm , and Anurx modular bifurcated graft was placed , and both common femoral arteries were repaired in the usual fashion .
He had pulsatile pulse volume recordings , in both lower extremities , and both renal arteries were noted to be patent , as were both internal iliac arteries .
His angiogram in the operating room , revealed no evidence of an endo leak .
Postoperatively , his course was relatively uncomplicated .
He did have an episode of a prolonged sinus pause in the recovery room , which resulted in transient loss of consciousness .
He responded to a Neo-Synephrine bolus , and had no further complications from this standpoint .
Dr. Rosean Fletcher , of the Cardiology Department was consulted , and it was his opinion that the sinus pause was related to increased vagal tone postoperatively , perhaps secondary to the epidural , as well as the patient &apos;s Atenolol use .
His Atenolol was held , and he had no further pauses during his stay .
His postoperative CT scan showed no evidence of endo leak , or graft kinking .
He maintained good peripheral pulses and warm feet postoperatively .
However , he did develop significant ecchymosis in both groins , extending down into his scrotum .
There was no evidence of significant groin hematomas .
He tolerated a regular diet .
His pain was adequately controlled with oral medications .
Accordingly , the patient was discharged to home on postoperative day 2 .
He will be visited by LDAMC for blood pressure and incision checks .
He will follow up with Dr. Dye in the Clinic ."

Discharge Date :
11/07/1993
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical problems and known transfusion dependent secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome admitted with decreased hematocrit .
The patient has had multiple previous admissions for cardiac and pulmonary disease .
He has had chronic anemia since 1990 , but a bone marrow biopsy in 07-92 , was consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome .
Over the past several months , the patient has had increasing transfusing requirements .
His transfusions have been complicated by fluid overload and congestive heart failure , secondary to ischemia cardiomyopathy .
His last admission was 9-14-93 , for a transfusion without complications , and prior to admission the patient reports having several days of increasing weakness , dizziness and fatigue .
His wife says his hands and lips have been blue .
Apparently , he had had a low hematocrit as an outpatient and was checked two weeks prior to admission but was not given transfusion because the patient did not want to come in at that time .
Aside from the above , the patient had felt that baseline without fever and chills or change in chronic cough .
He had no increase in his congestive heart failure symptoms , no chest pain , and no hemoptysis or changed in arthritis .
The patient did report taking a po antibiotic ( Ciprofloxacin ) for right great toe infection ( question of cellulitis vs. paronychia ) .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and placed in isolation on neutropenic precautions .
He was transfused with 1/2 units of packed red blood cells and given Lasix periodically to prevent him from going into congestive heart failure has he had on his prior transfusion .
Because his need for multiple transfusionsm he was transfused with radiated Leuco four units .
The patient had a good bump in his hematocrit , more than expected from 22 to high 20 &apos;s range next day after 3 1/2 units , but later that evening had a drop in his hematocrit so was given 4 more 1/2 units at this point for a total of 4 units packed red blood cells .
He again did not bump his hematocrit sufficiently and remained in the high 20 &apos;s after a total of 4 units , so he was given 2 more total units in 1/2 units segments the following day .
His hematocrit subsequently bumped to greater than 30 and was discharged with hematocrit of 32 on 11-7-93 .
The patient remained asymptomatic from a CHF stand point and felt much better after the transfusions .
It is unclear why the patient did not bump his hematocrit more but he did not appear to be hemolyzing from laboratory data , that is his LDH was within normal limits .
In addition , multiple stools were guaiaced and were all guaiac negative .
The patient was discharged with follow-up with his Hematologist , Dr. Eci Area and Rheumatologist , Dr. Taange Peter , and Cardiologist , Dr. Peter ."

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 63 year old gentleman who had initially presented with exertional chest pressure several weeks prior to this admission that would resolve with rest .
Stress echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 40% , hypokinesis of distal anterior wall , akinesis of distal inferior wall and apex .
The patient had a cardiac catheterization which revealed three vessel disease and the patient now presents for elective coronary artery bypass grafting .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was initially admitted to the medical service for optimization prior to his coronary artery bypass graft .
The patient was given stress dose steroids on the day prior to his surgery .
He was closely followed from his admission through to his discharge by the renal service for his transplant issues .
On 2016-02-15 , the patient was taken to the operating room and had an off pump coronary artery bypass graft performed with the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and posterior descending artery .
For details of this operation , please see the previously dictated operative note .
Postoperatively , the patient was transferred to the CSRU for close monitoring .
On the evening of postoperative day number zero , the patient had decreased urine output and was placed on a Lasix drip for diuresis .
The patient tolerated this well .
The renal service continued to follow close management of his immunosuppression .
On postoperative day number one , the patient was extubated and awakened from sedation .
He did well on this and his Levophed drip was weaned to off as tolerated .
Over the course of his Intensive Care Unit stay , the patient received six units of packed red blood cells for a low hematocrit .
He otherwise had a fairly uncomplicated postoperative course .
On postoperative day number three , the patient was transferred to the floor .
On postoperative day number four , the patient was noted to have a low platelet level of 43,000 .
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia antibody panel was sent .
Other than this , the patient did very well .
Chest tubes were removed when output was low .
Pacing wires were removed .
Physical therapy saw the patient and cleared the patient for discharge .
Ultimately , the patient was discharged on postoperative day number six tolerating a regular diet , adequate pain control on p.o. pain medications , and ambulating well with clearance of physical therapy ."

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Vinktlandfreierm was admitted from Owaleharbo Tanaminer Hospital to which he had been discharged approximately four days prior to admission .
He was noted to have dark stools per rectum and to be somewhat fluid overloaded .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted and found to have a significant hematocrit drop from 33.8 to 24.3 .
He was found operation be short of breath and was taken to dialysis for apparent fluid overload .
His gastrointestinal bleeding issues were investigated with an upper endoscopy which revealed multiple superficial gastric ulcerations consistent with an non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs gastropathy .
He had been discharged on one aspirin a day with 20 of Prilosec b.i.d.
The aspirin was discontinued and he had no further problems with gastrointestinal bleeding and a stable hematocrit the rest of his hospitalization .
During the course of his hospitalization , he became increasingly lethargic .
An extensive work-up was done for any metabolic abnormalities which was unrevealing .
He responded somewhat to lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy .
He had one positive blood culture for Vancomycin resistant enterococcus .
In the few days prior to his demise , he was intermittently somewhat lethargic buton the morning of June 25 , 1999 , his white count was noted to have increased from 8 to 13,000 .
That day , he was found to be acutely short of breath with a respiratory rate of 40 and oxygen saturations in the mid seventies .
He was put on 100% nonrebreather and his oxygen saturations improved to the low nineties .
Nasal trumpet suction was done and he was found to have food like material that was easily suctioned out .
He was also found to havesome pieces of toast in his mouth .
Blood gases were done and he was found to have a pH of 7.2 with a pCO2 of 21 .
Fingerstick glucose revealed a sugar of 12 .
A stat panel 7 confirmed that the sugar was 23 and that he had a new anion gap of 40 .
Repeat blood gas was done which was almost identical to the first .
The family was called and came in to see the patient .
An extensive family meeting was held and the family agreed that it did not make sense to intubate the patient and send him to the Intensive Care Unit .
In the acute setting , he had been started on levofloxacin , Flagyl , and Vancomycin .
These antibiotics were continued but the family decided that they wanted us to emphasize the comfort of the patient and pursue no further invasive measures .
The patient was made do not resuscitate / do not intubate .
At 2:30 on June 26 , 1999 , I was called to see the patient who had expired .
DISPOSITION :

MEDICINE
History of Present Illness :
52 y.o. male with ESLD due to HCV / EtOH Cirrhosis now with delta MS .
Recently d/c 'd on 05-15 after admission for hepatic encephalopathy versus opiate abuse .
Brought in by family for ams .
No hx available at Youville Hospital Katherine , except for abdominal pain .
Increasing tachypnea and tachycardia in Leola , cxr with likely aspiration pna versus chf , intubated .
Started on levo / flagyl / ceftriaxone and lasix for sbp and questionable meningitis .
Brief Hospital Course :
SBP :
Pt admitted with E coli SPB and bacteremia .
Was treated with ceftriaxone 2 gm IV daily with multiple repeat paracenteses .
Repeat taps did not revealed evidence of infection .
Patient was treated with 14 days of levoflox .
Resp failure :
Unclear etiology , but likely aspiration event in Monica .
Treated aspiration pneumonia .
Weaning and potential extubation complicated by mechanical disadvantage from large ascites as well as continued somnolence ( off sedation ).
we Performed frequent large vol taps and attempted to give diuretics , but were limited by renal failure .
The ascites quickly accumulated after each tap .
Patient was not a TIPS candidate .
Cirrhosis :
End-stage cirrhosis with refractory ascites .
Each time we have initiated diuretics , creatinine rose .
Patient was continued on nadolol ( as bp tolerated ) and lactulose )
Renal failure :
Creatinine elevation appears to be related to both elevated abdominal pressures from ascites as well as to attempts at diuresis .
AMS :
Likely hepatic encepholopathy initially , and later likely related to sedation and delayed clearance from liver disease .
Patient became increasingly hypotensive with a rising cr , eventually becoming pressor dependent .
Family meeting was held to discuss grave prognosis , and patient was made cmo .
He passed away shortly thereafter ."

The patient began having generalized tonic - clonic seizures in 1988 , which at the time were thought to be related to asthma medications .
At this time , his head CT was negative , and he was treated with Dilantin and Phenobarbital .
However , he continued to have left arm focal motor seizures and problems thinking .
In 2001-08-31 he stopped his medication and had a generalized tonic - clonic seizure in 12/94 .
He was diagnosed by biopsy with oligodendroglioma , and gross total resection by Dr. Redner in
95 revealed a low-grade oligodendroglioma .
He was followed by Dr. Gregory Dumas , with serial MRI 's.
In 2011-05-02 , he was requiring more ativan to control his seizures , and was increasingly disoriented and forgetful with headaches .
He had a repeat total resection in 4/04 by Dr. Peter Hoadley at Hallmark Health System which revealed anaplastic oligodendroglioma grade III .
He had radiation following the resection and was doing well on monthly Temodar until 2012-04-23 when he had a marked change in behavior , his balance was off , speech slurred , and he had difficulty using the computer .
A head MRI on 2012-04-24 revealed increasing tumor infiltration with increased edema and mass effect .
He underwent a right craniotomy with resection and gliadel wafers on 2012-05-02 at Hallmark Health System by Dr. Ackley .
Came for neurosurgery follow up on 05-21 , and had been having clear fluid leaking from his incision , as well as frontal headache , imbalance , bumping into things with his left leg and worsening tremors .
He was admitted for Lumbar drain placement
Brief Hospital Course : patient was admitted on 2012-05-24 after having drainage from his incision for the last couple of days .
He was seen in the brain tumor clinic on 05-21 and stitches were placed in the incision , however it continued to leak .
He had a lumbar drain placed .
He c/o of abd pain and distension on 05-25 he had a kub done which was negative .
on 05-26 he continued to c/o of epigastric pain had a chest x-ray done to due to decreased lung sounds .
The Chest x-ray showed free air .
general surgery was consulted and the patient was taken to the OR for exploratory laproratomy .
he was found to have a perforated sigmoid diverticulum .
He had a colostomy and partial colectomy .
patient recovered well from colocetomy .
He was found to have an abd abcess which was drained via CT guidance on 06-01 .
On 06-02 his lumbar drain pulled out .
he had to have it replaced , however , because his head incision began to leak again .
On 06-03 he was taken back to the OR for debridement of his head wound with removal of the remaining gliadel waffers .
He tolerated the procedure well , postop however he had a grand mal seizure and was intubated and sent to the ICU .
ID was consulted for both the abd abcess and possible meningitis given the large amount of wbc in the csf cultures .
Patient was placed on vancomycin 1 gm IV q12 and zosyn .
He was kept on antibiotics until 06-17 .
Neurologically he slowly woke up after the seizures and was extubated on 06-03 .
He was transfered to the step down unit and had his lumbar drain slowly weaned .
The lumbar drain was d/ced on 06-14 .
He had a head Ct which remains stable and head wound remain dry .
Neurologically he is awake and alert and oriented x 3 he is 07-05 in all muscle group bilat .

Pt was taken to Bridgewater Chelsea Soldier 's Home Hospital and started on unasyn IV .
Pt awoke later that night and felt unsteady on her feet and sustained a mechanical fall .
Per daughter , pt did not note chest pain , tachycardia , had a good PO intake and no noted seizure activity .
Pt was in severe "" back pain "" as per daughter which was treated with dilaudid .
CT of the neck revealed a possible C1 fracture and the X-ray at the OSH revealed intratrochanteric fracture of the right femur .
Pt was subsequently transferred to Hallmark Health System for orthopaedic evaluation .
In Monica at Hallmark Health System , pt was seen by the Trauma service where a CT of the neck revealed no fracture ( however , the c-collar was maintained secondary to pain ) .
The orthopaedic service recommended emergent repair of the intratrochanteric fracture secondary to instability .

Of note , there was a question of misplaced NGT .
When NGT tube was pulled out , it was noted to have respiratory-like secretions .
Concern for aspiration of mediations to lungs .
However , evaluation of CXR revealed NGT coiled in esophagus .
Pt 's respiratory distress is most likely on setting of aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis in the setting of depressed mental status secondary to post-operative narcotics .
Pt was pan-cultured and switched from unasyn ( started at OSH for foot ulcer ) to zosyn .
Vanco was added for possible nosocomial infection .
CTA was performed which was negative for PE , but revealed bilateral patchy ground glass opacities c/w aspiration vs. pneumonia vs. edema .
Pt was weaned down on ventilator , minimal secretions noted .
On 03-27 , pt was noted to have depressed mental status off all sedating medications ; mental status improved over the course of the day .
Pt was diuresed .
Atrial fibrillation was rate-controlled on dilt drip .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 70-year-old female with cryptogenic cirrhosis .
She has a history of esophageal varices and a history of an Upper GI bleed .
She has had one pervious episode of variceal bleeding with an unclear date .
However she is followed by a Dr. Joasscchird at Vaila Medical Center .
She was in her usual state of health until one day prior to admission when she felt increasing fatigue , nausea and vomiting productive of bright red blood and coffee ground emesis .
She also had some black , tarry stool in her colostomy bag .
At Vaila Medical Center , she had a hematocrit of 25 and was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells .
She had an upper endoscopy at Va Sit Namar Healthcare showing an esophagus filled with clots and small amount of bleeding varices , clot in the stomach with antral gastritis , and a normal duodenum .
She was started on Pitressin , a Blakemore tube was inserted .
She was transferred to the Ph University Of Medical Center Intensive Care Unit where on January 25 in the morning her hematocrit was found to be 27.4 .
She was transfused another 2 units of packed red blood cells over the course of the day and her hematocrit improved to 29.4 and then 31.2 .
The GI service was consulted and an upper endoscopy study showed grade III varices with no active bleeding and a clean base gastric ulcer possibly secondary to the Blakemore tube .
Her varices had stigmata of recent bleeding , were banded successfully .
after the procedure and 2 more units of packed red blood cells , the patient was hemodynamically stable and hematocrit was stable at 31.2 .
At that time she was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to Coden 2 for the Lemgarson Hospital service .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
As described above the patient was transfused an additional 2 units in the Intensive Care Unit and the patient also received an upper endoscopy study and her varices were banded .
On transfer to the Lemgarson Hospital service , her hematocrit was 31.2 , white count 11.1 and a platelet count 80 .
Her PT was 13.1 , PTT 26.7 .
The rest of her labs were unremarkable .
She was watched very closely while on the floor .
She was on GI bleed precautions at all times , was too large for IV .
She had a clot at the blood bank and she had BID hematocrits checked .
She was kept NPO until January 26 when she began to feel hungry .
At that time clear liquids were started .
All of her stools were guaiaced .
She also began Nadolol 40 mg QD to reduce her portal hypertension .
The GI consult team continued to follow her .
We also tried to contact her physician at Va Sit Namar Healthcare and was unsuccessful .
Therefore we decided to work up her cirrhosis .
She was described as having _______ cirrhosis and we decided that we wanted to try to figure out the etiology .
Her ferritin and iron studies did not reveal any evidence of hemochromatosis and her hep serologies were all negative .
She also had negative antimitochondrial antibody and she also had no evidence of ceruloplasmin .
Over the course of her admission were also sent an alpha-1-antitrypsin , which was negative .
She did very well over the course of her admission with no evidence of further bleeding .
Her hematocrit stayed stable at approximately 32 .
We also did an ultrasound guided paracentesis .
The peritoneal fluid showed a glucose of 244 , total protein 0.8 and a albumin of 0.5 , globulin 0.3 , amylase 16 , LDH of 51 .
The serum albumin gradient was 1.8 consistent with portal hypertension .
The cell count showed a white blood cell count of 160 with 16% polys .
She therefore _________ criteria for a spontaneous bacterial peritonitis .
Her platelet count stayed persistently low and we decided that it might be due to Cimetidine .
Therefore we switched her Cimetidine to Prilosec .
By the 2th the patient was feeling very well and desired to transfer or discharge to home .
She wanted to be closer to North Dakota .
After discussion with her private physician , Dr. Joasscchird , tel. 090-249-6079 , at Va Sit Namar Healthcare and Dr. Acrookesjo at Do Of Hospital , the patient was judged to be fit for discharge and she was sent home with AH and physical therapy .
She was quite able to climb stairs on her own in the hospital .
She is to follow up with Dr. Acrookesjo in one week and Dr. Work the gastrointestinal fellow here at PUOMC in 2 weeks .
She may require a repeat upper endoscopy study to see if she needs any rebanding .
The patient however complained of a persistent wheeze with beta blocker , therefore it was agreed that we would stop the beta blocker until the patient was followed up as an outpatient ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a past medical history notable for coronary artery disease and CABG x2 in 2001 .
The patient has felt unwell since 7/21 after his non-Q wave MI .
The patient , at this time , was started on Statin and developed in arthritis approximately one month later with joint pain , myalgia and fatigue .
No clear diagnosis was made .
The patient was presumed to have a rheumatoid factor negative , rheumatoid arthritis and he was prescribed Naprosyn , prednisone and sulfasalazine .
He had a CABG review in 2/21 .
His first CABG was in 02/89 .
Since 2/21 , he has had increasing weight loss of 30-49 pounds , night sweats which he attributed to the prednisone and increased fatigue and myalgias .
The patient has gradually taken to bed with decreasing activity .
In late 7/22 , sulfasalazine was started at one tab three times a day .
The patient subsequently developed diffuse abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , and decreased p.o. intake .
A guaiac positive stool was also noted in the month of July .
10 days prior to admission , the patient &apos;s primary care physician increased his sulfasalazine dose to two tabs three times a day .
The patient &apos;s prednisone was increased to 60 mg q.d. as the patient was diagnosed with an arthritis flare .
The prednisone dose was gradually tapered to 20 mg q.d.
The day before admission , the patient developed a fever to 102 degrees and increasing abdominal pain .
He presented to an outside hops where he was noted to be leukopenic with a white blood cell count of 0.6 , 0 neutrophils , a hematocrit of 32 , platelets of 326 , a MCV of 79 , and RDW of 22 .
The patient was given IV fluids and treated with imipenem , transferred to Ca Valley Hospital ED , where it was noted that the patient had face and neck swelling , as well as erythema and cervical lymphadenopathy .
The patient states that his swelling of his face began two days prior to admission and has doubled since then .
In the emergency department , CT of head , neck and abdomen were performed .
The CT of the abdomen was without lymphadenopathy , revealed a right renal cyst , otherwise unremarkable .
The CT of head and neck was likewise unremarkable showing no evidence of fasciitis or deep tissue thread .
No abscesses were noted .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
The patient denies shortness of breath , chest pain , orthopnea , no dysuria , hematuria , no visual changes , no rashes , no blurry vision .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was started on ceftazidime , nafcillin and Flagyl for concern of a soft tissue infection .
Neutropenic precautions were taken .
The patient had a bone marrow biopsy which showed myeloid arrest and probable neutropenia from a drug-related cause presumed to be the sulfasalazine .
Over the course of the hospitalization , the patient &apos;s white blood cell count rose from 0.4 to 6.3 after he was given G-CSF , a course lasting from 9/28/01 until 9/30/01 .
After the G-CSF , the absolute neutrophil count was greater than 8000 .
On 10/3/01 , the patient had a repeat head and neck CT , which showed a right parotitis and left submandibular lymphadenopathy with some necrosis .
No frank abscesses .
The patient &apos;s antibiotics were changed to clindamycin 300 mg q.i.d. and patient was also put on sialagogue .
Over the course of the hospitalization , the swelling and tenderness and erythema have steadily decreased .
Recommendations on antibiotics were made by infectious disease team , who was consulted .
Rheumatology was also consulted for patient and after workup , it was believed that arthritis may be a rheumatoid factor negative , rheumatoid polyarthritis .
Rheumatology recommended a taper of his prednisone to 20 mg q.d. and the patient will be followed by the rheumatology service .
The oncology service was also consulted for patient and performed a bone marrow biopsy .
Throughout his course during this hospitalization , the patient was also followed by the ENT service .
The ENT physicians did not recommend any procedures , incision and drainage for his right parotitis or left submandibular cervical lymph node necrosis .
The ENT team recommended watching patient in-house for two days after his repeat imaging on 10/3/01 , and to continue antibiotic coverage with clindamycin .
The patient had no positive blood cultures during his hospitalization and remained afebrile after the second day of admission ."

In the Emergency Department , she was started on a nesiritide drip and responded well with 2000 cc urine output .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Congestive heart failure :
Patient was diuresed effectively with nesiritide and Lasix .
Patient 's weight on admission was 250 pounds , and on the day of discharge was 244 pounds which was back to her dry weight .
She had lost the 6 pounds that she reported gaining in the four days prior to her hospitalization .
Patient was continued on her Toprol , her lisinopril , and her digoxin .
Patient 's Coumadin was held for right heart catheterization and biopsy , and then EP study with ICD placement .
Patient did have Woodrow Betty , SPEP , and anticardiolipin antibody sent for further workup of the etiology of her cardiomyopathy .
The Courtney , SPEP , and anticardiolipin antibody were all negative .
Her CKs did trend down over the course of her hospital stay , and in the setting of her known clean coronaries on cardiac catheterization in 2011-11-19 , it was believed that a myocarditis might be the cause of her elevated cardiac enzymes and also could have exacerbated her congestive heart failure .
Patient did receive a right heart catheterization , which showed elevated wedge pressures and biopsy specimens were obtained of the right ventricle .
The results of these biopsies are still pending in pathology .
Post right heart catheterization and right ventricular biopsy , the patient was sent to the CCU for a Swan - guided therapy in the setting of her elevated wedge pressures and low cardiac output .
In the CCU , she was put on milrinone with good results .
Patient was also seen by the Pulmonary service here and had pulmonary function tests done as part of a pretransplant workup .
There is no pulmonary process to exclude her from the transplant list as noted by the Pulmonary service .
Patient did receive an ICD during this hospital admission without complication .
Patient was in bigeminy during the course of her hospital stay , and did have frequent runs of ectopy as noted on telemetry .
2. Her right lower lobe infiltrate :
Patient did report a cough productive of green sputum on admission .
She received a full course of azithromycin for this with resolution of her cough and sputum production .
On discharge , the patient was restarted on her Coumadin , which was held for her right heart catheterization , and her biopsy , and her ICD placement .
She was also continued on all her heart failure medications including her Toprol , her lisinopril , her digoxin , and her Lasix ."

Service :
MEDICAL ICU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 57-year-old nursing home resident female , who had been in her usual state of health until about three weeks ago when the daughter noted she was sleeping more .
Per record , she has had multiple episodes in the last week of changes in mental status .
EMTs called many times .
The patient would awake prior to arrival and not need transfer .
The patient was seen at the Leonard Morse/Metrowest Medical Center on 09-28 .
No localizing etiology of delta MS .
That evening she was unresponsive and the patient was brought to Amesbury Hospital Hospital .
There her oxygen she was sating 65% on room air , increased to 98% with a nonrebreather mask .
There an ABG was done which showed an ABG of 7.42 , 62 , and 55 .
She had a head CT that was negative .
Chest x-ray that was questionable left lower lobe infiltrate .
Lumbar puncture was performed and the micro cultures are still pending .
She was seen by Psychiatry at the outside hospital , but noted there was no psychoses , but delirium .
The patient 's mental status waxed and waned there .
She also had a K of 6.0 and given 30 of Kayexalate , 5 of Haldol , 2 mg of Ativan given for
agitation , and 2 mg of ceftriaxone was given for a temperature of 101.3 with a concern for meningitis as a LP was done prior .
Patient was transferred to the Kindred Hospital Melendez the patient 's primary care provider was here .
She is currently being seen by Addison Gilbert Hospital Group .
On arrival to Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary , she was unresponsive with an oxygen saturation of 72% on 6 liters .
She was placed on 50% vent mask , which improved her oxygenation to 97% .
Patient was placed on BiPAP .
Original ABG here before BiPAP was 7.19 , 102 , and 92 .
After being placed on BiPAP , her blood pressure decreased to the 80s .
She responded to 1 liter of IV fluids , normal saline and blood pressure remained stable .
Patient had peripheral IV x1 placed and right femoral line placed in the Matthew .
When laying flat , her sats decreased to 50% on 30% FIO2 , PEEP of 10 , and pressure support of 5 .
Her ABG at the time was 7.24 , 91 , and 38 .
Once the patient sat up , her sats improved and her airway was no longer obstructed .
After a history on BiPAP about a half an hour , her ABG was 7.29 , 79 , and 106 on 30% pressure support of 5 and PEEP of 10 .
Patient was intermittently awaking .
She denied any pain and was not answering questions at the time .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure issues :
The patient presented with changes in mental status , pCO2 of 100 , pH of 7.19 , decreasing sats on arrival likely element of obstructive-sleep apnea .
She was monitored overnight .
She had admitted to the CMED and had multiple episodes of apnea throughout the night .
She was placed on pressure support , which improved her saturations and decreased her hypercarbia .
Patient improved that her mental status with improvement of her oxygenation and ventilation as well as for correction of her respiratory acidosis .
Patient was eventually placed on BiPAP on hospital day three , on the date prior to discharge of BiPAP settings of 12/8/5 liters of oxygen with saturations of 96% with a gas of 7.38 , 67 , and 91 with an aim of a goal pCO2 of 67 .
She only had one episode of apnea on the day prior to discharge .
2. Delta MS/mental status issues :
Most likely her waxing and waning mental status and hypercarbia/hypoxia compounded by infection of pneumonia and UTI .
With improvements of her ventilation and oxygenation and treatment with levofloxacin of her UTI and pneumonia , her mental status greatly improved on hospital day two without further waxing and waning .
Her daughters came by and visited her , and reported that she was at her baseline mental status on the day prior to discharge .
B12 , folate , RPR were all sent that were unremarkable as causes for delta MS .
We are awaiting results of the lumbar puncture from the outside hospital , but on hospital day two .
Those cultures are still pending at the time .
Patient was also given multivites .
3. Fever issues :
The patient initially presented with T max of 101.3 at outside hospital with increasing white blood cell counts and a positive urinalysis .
A chest x-ray with bilateral patchy infiltrates likely pneumonia and UTI .
Upon calling the outside hospital , the urine was growing out Klebsiella , and patient was given a 10 day course of levofloxacin to cover both the pneumonia and UTI .
Blood cultures and urine cultures are still pending at this hospital visit and the CSF fluid from Whitter Rehabilitation Hospital needs to be further evaluated .
Patient on the day of discharge was afebrile with a decreasing white count x48 hours .
4. Acute renal failure issues :
Creatinine initially presented at 1.3 .
Patient is known to have a baseline of 1.0 , most likely hypovolemia and prerenal .
A FENa was sent , was 0.3% .
Patient was gently hydrated and IV fluids started up on a p.o. diet regimen .
On hospital day two , her creatinine returned to 0.8 , and she remained with a creatinine of 0.8 for the remainder of her hospital stay .
Patient's K was followed , and trended back down to normal on the day of discharge at 3.9 .
5. Elevated transaminases :
Patient had no right upper quadrant pain .
Stewart sign was negative .
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed that showed no hepatic or biliary pathology likely due to acute phase stress changes given the fact that she had no clinical symptoms .
There is no need to followup these transaminases .
6. Congestive heart failure history :
Patient was stable without evidence of CHF on chest x-ray .
Followed her sats likely due to obstructive-sleep apnea and hypoventilation .
Patient was restarted on her beta blocker and .......- receptor blocker on hospital day two given that her creatinine had stabilized .
Patient had no further cardiac issues at this time .
She was on telemetry without any episodes of any rhythm abnormalities .
7. CMED CCU :
The patient had some vaginal bleeding x2 days .
Patient had a history of fibroids during this hospitalization .
Followed her examination .
Her hematocrit remained stable throughout this course .
Patient is strongly encouraged to followup with her outside primary care provider to followup for the vaginal bleeding given her history of fibroids and question metaplasia of the endometrium .
8. Heme :
Her hematocrit remained stable .
She had a history of nucleated RBCs likely secondary to stress and hypoxia during this admission .
Hemolysis laboratories were negative .
Patient was restarted on her iron supplementation .
Reticulocyte count was performed that was negative .
9. FEN :
She was NPO with a decrease in her mental status .
We slowly advanced her diet as her mental status improved and repleted her electrolytes , and started on her p.o. medications on hospital day two .
10. Diabetes :
Patient had q.i.d. fingersticks with a Humalog sliding scale and NPH doses were cut in half while she was NPO , and they were brought back to her normal doses on the day of discharge with a full diet .
11. Code status :
Full .
Two daughters came by and requested to be health care proxies as patient approved .
Documentation is in her medical chart .
12. Prophylaxis :
The patient was on subQ Heparin for DVT and ranitidine for GI prophylaxis .
DISPOSITION:
The patient is to be discharged today to Lahey Clinic - North Shore Hospital for long-term pulmonary ........ therapy and further evaluation of her obstructive-sleep apnea ."

1 L was removed .
At about 2:30 pm , he was found to have worsening mental status .
In that setting he was hypotensive down to the 92/45 , and was given 1 L NS .
Fs was also checked 179 .
At that time , it seems that he had been on T peace since 4 am today .

he was taken to Williams ICU until 08-09 when he was discharged to Waltham/Weston Hospital Rehab .
he had a peg tube and tracheostomy prior to d/c .
He had been chronicallyl vent dependent .
His companion states that they have been trying to wean him down at rehab .
his basline mental staus apparently responds with his head shaking , and also try to write sentences .

Brief Hospital Course :
Assessment and Plan :
This is a 79 y/o M with h/o HTN , DM , recent CVA , chronic ventilatory failure , CRI on HD who presents with change in MS and febrile in the Amanda , admitted to CMED .
# Altered mental status : Ct scan with no evidence of new intracraneal bleeding .
Patient febrile in the Amanda .
High WBC .
It was thought that it could have been a combination of hypotension , hypercapnia and infection .
He was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics .
Despite having a profund limitation communicating given his neurological status , his mental changes seemed to improved initially .
However later on during his course , his mental status deteriorated , being even less responsive .
# ID :
Patient febrile and with a high WBC on admission .
After starting broad spectrum antibiotics - cefepime - vancomycin and flagyl ( for initial concern of aspiration pneumonia ), he responded clinically .
Urine cx from Rehab showed gram negative rods > 100 K enterobacter cloacae .
Urine Cx in house grew Citrobacter Freundi and his sputum grew Acinetobacter Baummani .
Since there was no more evidence of gram positive infections , vancomycin was discontinued and cefepime was kept .
# Fevers : in the Amanda , high WBC , possible pneumonia .
Also possible source sinus infections given findings on intial CT ( see summary in significant studies ). He did not spike any fevers after being transfer to the CMED from the Amanda .
# Resp : Patient was intermitentely switched from AC to Pressure support trials .
However , after Patient did well .
Then trach mask trials were done .
He tolerated this well , although he required PS overnight .
# ESRD on hemodyalisis : Renal service was consulted and HD was continued .
# CV :
Rhythm : NSR , not tachycardic .
Pump : With trace of lower extremity edema .
X ray suggested some pulmonary edema on admission .
Despite this findings , he was supported with 40% FIO2 most of the time .
CAD : On admission Ck low normal , MB not done .
Troponin 0.44. 
It was more likely due to CRI .
Second set 12 hours apart , showed no changes .
s/p stroke : continue aspirin , statin , plavix
# Hypotension : per referral form .
Intially concern for sepsis in the setting of fevers and high blood count .
His BP medications were held on admission .
Patient did not require pressors .
His blood pressure remained stable and BP meds were restarted .
# FEN :
Tube feedings were started thorugh peg tube .
On 2013-09-08 , patient pulled out peg tube .
Temporary foley was placed and on 2013-09-11 ,
On 2013-09-12 after deterioration of his mental status and also of his blood pressure , goals of care were discussed with his HCP .
It was decided to direct goals of care towards confort care .

The patient notes he developed worsening foot pain and ulcers four months ago .
Due to his worsening blood glucose , he was started on insulin .
His foot ulcers continued to develop , and the patient complained of pain in his feet ; primarily at night .
The patient was referred to for Vascular consultation because of the ulcerations and pain and scheduled for a lower extremity angiography on the day of admission , but due to his renal failure the procedure was cancelled .
The patient showed peaked T waves on electrocardiogram , and he was transferred to Medicine .
The patient denied any oliguria , hematuria , dysuria , foamy urine , flank pain , abdominal pain , or urinary hesitancy .

The patient is an 83 - year-old male with a history of diabetes , steroid-treated polymyalgia rheumatica , hypertension , benign prostatic hypertrophy , and high cholesterol without presented to the hospital for lower extremity angiograph ; however , that was deferred due to new onset renal failure .
1. RENAL FAILURE :
The patient was initially thought to be prerenal , and his renal status improved after hydration and increased oral intake .
He did have a magnetic resonance angiography of his kidneys which showed mild right-sided renal artery stenosis .
His renal function fluctuated throughout his hospital stay , and when he was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit he did have decreased urine output in the setting of cardiogenic shock .
2. CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient with severe peripheral vascular disease .
During his hospital stay , he developed some nonsustained ventricular tachycardia .
He also became hypotensive on 07-02 in the setting of infection .
The patient had a central line placed and went into sustained ventricular tachycardia that was treated with lidocaine .
After being treated with lidocaine , the patient became apneic requiring intubation and transfer to the Coronary Care Unit .
His nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was treated with a lidocaine drip .
It was found that he had elevated troponins and likely an ischemic event on the 07-02 .
A repeat echocardiogram showed a decreased ejection fraction from prior .
He had a cardiac catheterization which revealed 3-vessel disease .
Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted , and due to the patient 's acute illness , they wanted to re-evaluate after the patient was extubated .
The patient continued to have intermittent episodes of ventricular tachycardia .
He was continued on lidocaine and eventually changed over to amiodarone .
He was noted to be cardiogenic shock requiring pressors .
Of note , he likely suffered a second ischemic event during his Coronary Care Unit stay .
The patient did have a Swan-Ganz catheter in place and had a low cardiac output .
The patient 's family eventually decided to withdraw care , and the patient was extubated and passed away on 2009-07-12 .
2. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient was initially treated with levofloxacin for a left lower lobe infiltrate and a urinary tract infection .
He then developed positive blood cultures with Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to levofloxacin , and that was continued .
When the patient became hypotensive and required intubation and pressors , his antibiotics were broadened , and he was put on stress-dose steroids .
He was found to have bilateral Staphylococcus pneumonia .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
In brief , the patient is a 64 - year-old male with a significant history for coronary artery disease , status post three myocardial infarctions and also status post five vessel coronary artery bypass graft in ' 89 and status post multiple percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties who recently had a catheterization done in Mississippi and stent placed in 2013-03-24 .
The patient did well until approximately three to four weeks prior to presentation when he began to experience increased dyspnea on exertion .
One week prior to presentation , he had chest pain leading to a repeat catheterization at Springfield on 07-30 which showed narrowing of the stent and an ejection fraction of approximately 20% .
No intervention was done at that point .
On the evening prior to admission , the patient was awoken with chest pressure radiating to the neck anginal
equivalent which was relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin .
This episode happened three times that night and finally on the fourth re-awakening , the patient presented to the Emergency Department at Springfield and was transferred to the Faulkner Hospital for coronary revascularization .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was medically managed initially and then underwent on 2013-08-09 , coronary artery bypass grafting x2 and a mitral valve annuloplasty with placement of intra-aortic balloon pump .
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in relatively stable condition .
On postoperative day #1 , his balloon pump was weaned and the patient was transferred at 2 units of packed red blood cells .
He also began to wean off the ventilator .
On postoperative day #1 in the evening , the patient was noted to go into atrial fibrillation , for which he was controlled and started on amiodarone , after which he converted again to normal sinus rhythm .
He was extubated during postoperative day #1 .
On postoperative day #2 , the patient was noted to be relatively stable .
His balloon pump had already been removed and on postoperative day #3 , he was transferred to the floor on Lopressor and amiodarone in normal sinus rhythm .
On the floor , the patient was noted to do extremely well .
Physical therapy was consulted and the patient was ambulating extremely well with minimal assistance .
On postoperative day #4 , he remained afebrile with stable vital signs on Lopressor at 25 mg po bid and an amiodarone dose .
His left chest tube was discontinued at this time and his right chest tube was removed the following day on
postoperative day #5 .
Currently , the patient is postoperative day #6 .
He remains afebrile with stable vital signs and the patient is ambulating to a level 5 with physical therapy and wishes to be discharged home today ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 73 year old male with a recent history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and hypercholesterolemia who presented to the Emergency Department with the chief complaint of syncope .
The patient was discharged from The Hospital for Orthopedics with the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism about six months prior to the current admission and was started on Warfarin .
One month prior to this admission , the patient reports not feeling well with worsening gastric distress .
A few weeks prior to admission , he fell down on his back and started taking ibuprofen 1000 mg once a day for pain and Vioxx in addition to his aspirin and Coumadin regimen .
The night prior to admission , he was found by his wife on the bathroom floor in a pool of urine , unresponsive without any body movements , post-ictal state .
EMS was activated , however , the patient refused to go to the hospital .
A similar episode happened at 2 a.m. the same night and at 07:45 on the day of admission , the patient lost consciousness once again when he was trying to sit up .
He was then transferred to The Hospital for Orthopedics .
The patient reports some nausea and epigastric pressure which is post-prandial .
He denies any emesis , melena , diarrhea or constipation .
He describes the room spinning with attempts to sit upright .
No history of previous episodes was noted .
Denies incontinence .
He does have diaphoresis and weakness with orthostatic changes .
In the Emergency Department , stool guaiac was trace positive .
Hematocrit was 24.8 , with a baseline of 46 .
Gastric lavage was grossly positive for coffee ground material .
His INR was found to be 4.4 .
He was given Vitamin K 10 mg subcutaneously , 2.5 liters of normal saline , two units of packed red blood cells and two units of fresh frozen plasma and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was transferred to Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management for acute GI bleed .
1. Gastrointestinal bleed :
The patient continued to receive blood transfusions on the floor and serial hematocrits with serial INR checks were drawn .
As he was receiving his third unit of packed red blood cells , the patient became tachycardic and short of breath .
His temperature raised from 98.6 F. , to 101.0 F.
He was shown to have rigors .
The transfusion was stopped and the patient was given Tylenol 1 mg with epinephrine , 100 mg of hydrocortisone , 25 mg of Benadryl and Demerol 15 as well as Pepcid .
He had emesis times three of 75 cc of coffee ground material .
The patient also desaturated to the low 80 s and was started on a non-rebreather mask .
His saturations improved quickly on 100% non-rebreather mask within 15 to 20 minutes .
Shortly after his mental status changed ; he became disoriented and euphoric and continued to be in this state for two more hours .
After that period of time , his mental status gradually improved and he continued to receive his blood transfusions requiring a total of ten units of packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma to reach a hematocrit of 30.0 , which remained stable for the duration of his stay .
On admission , the patient was started on high dose proton pump inhibitors for prophylaxis .
On Wednesday , 11-25 , an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and was significant for the following findings :
Medium hiatal hernia , Barrett's esophagus , erosion of the gastroesophageal junction , granularity , erythema and congestion of the antrum in the pre-pyloric region compatible with gastritis .
Erosions in the antrum and pre-pyloric region , granularity , erythema and congestion of the anterior bulb and posterior bulb compatible with duodenitis .
It was recommended by Gastroenterology that the patient is to stay off aspirin for at least four to six weeks at discharge to prevent further bleeding .
2. Cardiovascular :
During transfusion reaction episode , the patient had an episode of tachycardia ranging from 134 to 158 , for one to two hours .
EKG during this episode was taken and showed sinus tachycardia ; however , serial enzymes were significant for CK peaking at 1075 , MB peaking at 114 and MB index peaking at 10.8 , consistent with myocardial damage .
The day following this episode , EKG showed loss of R wave progression in anterior leads and Q waves in leads III and AVF consistent with anteroseptal myocardial infarction .
The patient 's blood pressures remained stable during his stay .
He had no episodes of arrhythmia on Telemetry .
Cardiology consultation was obtained .
The myocardial infarction was attributed to demand ischemia secondary to acute hematocrit drop exacerbated by tachycardia secondary to blood transfusion reaction .
Further Cardiologic work-up was suggested as an outpatient at four to six weeks post discharge .
The patient was started on Lopressor , Lipitor and Lisinopril .
3. After ten units of packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma transfusions , the patient 's hematocrit remained stable at above 30 .
His INR decreased to 1.3 at the time of discharge .
He required no blood transfusions for four days prior to discharge .
4. History of pulmonary embolism likely secondary to frequent flying .
The need for further anti-coagulation was discussed with the patient 's attending , Dr. Coleman , and it was decided not to continue anti-coagulation due to increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding .
The patient remained symptom free during his stay in the hospital , saturating well in room air .
5. Endocrine :
The patient was restarted on Levothyroxine soon after admission .
His hemoglobin A1C was sent and it was pending at the time of discharge .
6. Single mental status change times two hours during episode of blood transfusion reaction .
Was most likely due to multiple drugs administered during the episode including Demerol .
After this episode , the patient 's mental status remained clear for the rest of the duration of his stay .
7. Prophylaxis :
The patient was sent home on proton pump inhibitors .
His Helicobacter pylori serology was sent and was pending at the time of discharge ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Larsen was a 50-year-old salesman who in 12/26 was noted to have an elevated platelet count of 778,000 .
He was found to have CML .
He was admitted on 06/07/00 for a matched , unrelated donor bone marrow transplant .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient received his bone marrow transplant on 06/12/00 .
His course was then complicated by fevers and neutropenia which were treated with antibiotics and a diffuse erythroderm felt to be a drug reaction .
On 06/24/00 the patient was found to have pulmonary infiltrates and some hemoptysis .
A bronchoscopy was done and there was blood found in the upper airways but no evidence of blood in alveoli so it was not felt to be DAH .
On 06/26/00 due to agitation , change in mental status and increased respiratory distress , the patient was intubated .
It was felt at that time that the changing mental status and respiratory distress might be due to a combination of medication and worsening mucositis .
Although the patient &apos;s pain and sedation meds were adjusted he continued to be agitated and there was difficulty weaning him off the vent .
Because of this continued agitation , a head CT was performed on 07/01/00 and it revealed an intraparenchymal hemorrhage .
Neurosurgery was consulted but due to the severity of the bleed surgery was not considered an option .
The patient gradually lost brain systolic ejection murmur function and was pronounced dead on 07/02/00 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mrs. Dua is a 34 year old white female with an unclear history of hypertension for at least five years .
She was in her usual state of health until around 12:40 on October 19 , when while on the phone , started to have difficulty in talking .
Her speech became slurred , this was followed a few seconds after by weakness and numbness of her arm and leg .
She did not complain of headache , diplopia , or any other neurological symptoms .
She was seen at A Memorial Hospital where her blood pressure was measured at 240/120 and was found to have a mild left hemiparesis .
She was then transferred to Ro Woodma Healthcare for further management .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Given the localization of the hematoma and the history of hypertension , the most likely cause for Mrs. Dua &apos;s cerebellar hemorrhage is hypertension .
A magnetic resonance imaging study will be scheduled as an outpatient in three months to rule out a small vascular malformation if responsible for the hemorrhage .
At the time of discharge , Mrs. Dua has had a remarkable recovery .
She is now able to walk fitfully and use her left hand with no problem .
The exam is remarkable for a mild leftsided face , arm and leg weakness and sensory deficit that should further improve with physical therapy and occupational therapy help .
She will be followed by the OT / PT dept. for that .
Her hypertension was difficult to manage initially and required three days of Intensive Care Unit with A-line and Nipride intravenously .
It was finally under control with high doses of Captopril , Nifedipine , and hydrochlorothiazide .
The workup to rule out secondary cause of hypertension given the patient &apos;s young age and the difficulty controlling the blood pressure was started as an inpatient and will be completed by Dr. ______________as an outpatient .
So far no secondary causes of hypertension were identified but causes like lymphocytic ? chromocytoma or renal artery stenosis have not been ruled out yet ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 35-year-old gentleman with HIV on HAART with last CD4 count of 268 and undetectable viral load who was referred to the emergency room via his PCP for progressive throat pain and edema .
His throat pain began 2 to 3 days prior to admission , initially treated with ibuprofen , seen in an outside hospital emergency room day prior to admission where he received IV penicillin and was sent home .
In clinic today , the patient desaturated to low 90 s with ambulation and also had complaints of progressive swelling "" like my throat is going to close up "" with increasing drooling , unable to swallow the HIV medications .
Also noted to have low-grade temperature of 99 to 100 degrees with productive cough and yellow sputum times 1 day with
right ear pain .
No subjective shortness of breath .
The patient describes whole body numbness .
He currently notes improvement in his throat pain after some Decadron and clindamycin .
He was seen by CMED CSRU in the emergency room and the exam was consistent with supraglottitis .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Review of systems was negative for history of opportunistic infections or prior hospitalizations .
Of note , his CD4 count was less than 200 last winter .
He believes he is up-to-date on all his vaccines .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
This is a 35-year-old gentleman with HIV on HAART , last CD4 count 268 with undetectable viral load who was initially admitted to the CMED CSRU for supraglottitis with significant edema .
PROBLEM LIST :
1. Epiglottitis / supraglottitis .
The patient was observed in the CMED CSRU for 48 hours and noted to have decrease in swelling on serial exams .
He was followed by the CMED CSRU Service and was started on IV Decadron initially in addition to IV Unasyn , which he tolerated well .
His edema was improving and was starting to tolerate p.o.
His airway and symptoms continued to improve and remained stable .
The patient was stable for transfer to the floor , was treated with over 72 hours of IV Unasyn , and then transitioned to oral regimen of Augmentin to be continued as an outpatient .
Eventually , his IV steroids were transitioned to a p.o. steroid taper , which he tolerated well , and was discharged on a steroid taper also with CMED CSRU follow-up as an outpatient .
His oxygenation and symptoms remained stable and again tolerated p.o. without difficulty .
Eventually , as the patient remained hemodynamically stable , his airway remained stable , and he was tolerating PO s, he was transitioned to the floor where he remained otherwise stable and asymptomatic .
His voice improved during the course of his stay and was talking clearly by the time of discharge .
He remained afebrile during the course of his stay after transfer to the floor and per CMED CSRU was to be discharged on a 2-week course of Augmentin with follow-up with Dr. Thibodeau in 2 weeks ' time in addition to a Medrol Dosepak .
1. HIV .
Once , the patient was tolerating p.o. , the patient was restarted on his HAART regimen and remained stable from that perspective ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 68 year old , right handed caucasian female , former R.N. who complained of several days of vertigo , one day of double vision , dysarthria and worsening of vertigo .
She was seen at the outside hospital and put on aspirin for two days .
An magnetic resonance imaging study showed basilar artery disease , questionable aneurysm .
The patient was transferred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
An angiogram on 11/3 was consistent with thrombosis at the mid basilar artery .
The patient was put on heparin and was stable since .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit after her angiogram .
She was aggressively anticoagulated with heparin .
A small intimal tear in the arch of the aorta during the angiogram , was without sequelae .
She was doing well with at least 4+ strength in all of her extremities , when on 11/13 , she had an acute drop in her systolic blood pressure to 70 for unclear reasons and without evidence of acute sepsis .
This was accompanied by substantial decrement in neurologic function .
For a short time , she seemed &quot; locked in &quot; .
She has made slow progress since then and at the time of discharge has 4-strength at the left elbow and 4+ in the left wrist and hand .
Trace movement of the right elbow and 4-strength of the right wrist and hand .
4-to 4+ strength at the left ankle , 4+ strength at the right knee and right ankle .
She is unable to lift either foot off the bed .
The extra ocular movements are full .
Tongue protrudes 4 cm .
She is drowsy at times , but generally alert , responsive , interactive , able to talk in two to three word sentences when she wants to .
She has severe memory deficits , but nevertheless , is able to engage in conversation , answers questions , names things well , does calculations and recognizes family members and states preferences .
She has been working with Speech Therapy , occupational therapy and physical therapy closely and should continue to show improvement .
She is anticoagulated on Coumadin and this has been stable .
She is do not resuscitate in agreement with the wishes of her multiple family members .
Follow up computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown infarction in bilateral basis pontis , mid brain , the superior cerebellar areas , left thalamus , bilateral temporal lobes medially and inferiorly and left posterior communicating artery .
The patient had fevers sporadically during this hospitalization with rising white blood counts .
A chest X-ray documented a progressing left lower lobe infiltrate .
Initially this improved on Clindamycin and Cefotetan , but fevers recurred on this antibiotic regimen .
Sputum grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae , and she was treated with Gentamicin and Ancef for 14 days intravenous ( bug being sensitive to these two drugs ) .
A left pleural effusion developed and this was tapped with ultrasound guidance , and found to be sterile , and without evidence of empyema .
The patient is on Ciprofloxacin .
The day of discharge is day #3 of 7 , after which antibiotics should be totally discontinued .
She has developed bad thrush in this setting , she is not yet able to swallow and so she is on Nystatin swish and spit five times a day .
She also gets Peridex to clean out her mouth .
Once her liver enzymes are completely normal , a seven day course of Fluconazol may be helpful if the thrush is not spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics .
She has been afebrile for greater than 10 days , including several days on oral antibiotics .
The patient &apos;s liver enzymes were noted to be elevated mid way through her hospital course , to about three times normal , especially the SGOT and SGPT .
These have spontaneously reversed , and are nearly normal at the time of discharge .
A right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones , without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis .
The exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear , but we are being careful about administering drugs , which might irritate the liver .
The patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization .
Iron studies are all entirely normal , her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with hypoproliferation as well as multiple phlebotomies .
The plan is to give her folic acid , but not iron .
The patient &apos;s potassiums have been repeatedly low and require daily checks and repletion .
This is thought due to the extensive course of Gentamicin which she received .
This must be carefully checked despite the standing order for potassium .
The patient has had low sodiums during this hospitalization .
This may due to her central nervous system process or her pulmonary process , with fluids administered as described , she should not have any problems from this .
Her sodiums were never below 130 .
She does well with tube feeds .
Her tube feeds orders are as follow :
full strength Replete with fiber at 70 cc. per hour .
In addition , the patient gets 250 cc. of juice ( not water ) three times a day .
She also gets Lactinex granules three packages in each bottle of tube feeds .
She also gets Metamucil one teaspoon with the first bolus of juice each day .
Please note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist , showed that the patient is aspirating at this time , but there is great hope from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon .
It is for this reason that she is discharged with an nasogastric tube and that no plans for G tube placement are made at this time .
She has a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that has not been worked up .
She did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes .
In the first week of November , her electrocardiogram showed T wave inversions in the lateral leads , correlating with an increase in the LDH , but not CK .
This did not normalize with administration of Isordil and the patient denied chest pain at this time .
As of 4/7 , her electrocardiogram had reverted back to normal and there is no evidence of congestive heart failure or continued electrocardiogram changes , and chest pain is absent .
Her cholesterol was 350 here .
She has been off of her hypercholesterol medicines .
These can be restarted when it is deemed reasonable , in view of her acute disease and recently elevated liver enzymes .
Note that the liver enzymes were normal on admission , at which time she was taking all of the above cholesterol medicines ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 56 - year-old man without any significant past medical history who presented to the emergency room after the sudden onset of headache while he was riding a bicycle .
He characterized this headache as the worst headache of his life and had associated nausea and vomiting times one .
He also complained of dizziness at the time of headache onset .
He presented to the Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial VA Hospital emergency room , where an initial head CT scan was read as negative .
However , a lumbar puncture was done , in which tube 1 showed 4800 red blood cells and tube 4 showed 4000 red blood cells .
The patient was sent for an MRI of the head , which raised the question of a right posterior cerebral artery aneurysm .
The CT scan was revealed and , on second analysis , it was thought that it was suspicious for a subarachnoid hemorrhage in the suprasellar cistern .
The patient was then admitted for further evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit , where a continued cerebral angiogram was done that was essentially normal , without evidence of any obvious aneurysm .
The patient was observed for two days with a repeat CT scan showing no changes from the previous examination .
The headache stabilized after the patient was transferred to the floor .
The patient continued to do well and the decision was made to discharge him ."

History of Present Illness :
This is a 60 year old male with new onset chest pain .
Nuclear myocardial perfusion study was notable for a moderate fixed defect within the inferior wall and cardiac apex .
His ejection fraction however appeared preserved at 73% with mild inferior wall hypokinesis .
Subsequent cardiac catheterization at Nantucket Cottage Hospital Hospital on 2014-04-16 was significant for severe two vessel coronary artery disease .
Angiography revealed a right dominant system with a 40% lesion in the distal left main, several tight lesions in the proximal and mid left anterior descending artery , and a 90% stenosis in the proximal circumflex .
The right coronary artery had mild diffuse plaquing but no evidence of focal stenosis .
Based upon the above results , he was transferred to the Mediplex Rehab Hospital for surgical revascularization .
Brief Hospital Course :
Mr. Chester was admitted to the cardiac surgical service and underwent routine preoperative evaluation .
He remained pain free on medical therapy .
Workup was unremarkable and he was cleared for surgery .
On 04-18 , Dr. Oneill performed off pump coronary artery bypass grafting .
For surgical details , please see seperate dictated operative note .
Following the operation , he was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring .
Within 24 hours , he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without incident .
Given hypotension and bradycardia , he was slow to wean from Neosynephrine .
Low dose beta blockade was eventually resumed .
Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed without complication .
On postoperative day three , he transferred to the SDU .
He maintained a normal sinus rhythm without atrial or ventricular arrhythmias .
He remained in sinus bradycardia ( rate 50-60 ) and tolerated low dose beta blockade .
On POD #6 his creatinine became slightly elevated at 1.4 , his lasix was discontinued and the following day his creatinine was stable at 1.4 .
He continued to progress and was eventually cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day 7 .
His discharge chest x-ray showed persistent bibasilar atelectasis with only tiny pleural effusions .
Of note , he will need to remain on Plavix for three months postop given the off pump procedure .
In addition , he will need to remain on Imdur given use of his right internal mammary artery as a "" free "" arterial graft in preventing 
vasospasm ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus , three-vessel coronary artery bypassgraft , congestive heart failure , who presents with a humeral fracture .
The patient is admitted for preoperative and orthopedic evaluations .
The patient presented with a comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus when he slipped over the stairs , about to board an airplane back to Jeglas Blvd. , Jolouisrowarlihis , Alabama 86071 .
The fracture was seen by Orthopedics and was reduced .
During conscious sedation , the patient developed bigeminy ( the patient was sedated , did not feel chest pain or shortness of breath ) .
The patient presented to Bri Health in order to be evaluated for preoperative clearance .
He was reported to have had a myocardial infarction in the past ( EKG positive for ischemia , exercise tolerance test positive , cardiac catheterization positive , the patient is now status posta three-vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1987 ) .
The patient also hada history of arrhythmia , found approximately ten years ago , unknown what type .
The patient was on coumadin recently , ? whether for the arrhythmia .
Coumadin was reportedly discontinued approximately six months ago secondary to planned surgery for diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma .
The patient did not have chest pain until approximately 1-1/2 years ago , when he began to have chest tightness ( pressure ) approximately every three months with stress .
The patient has no chest pain when walking slowly and can walk approximately 1.5 miles .
He can climb approximately three flights of stairs before becoming short of breath .
He does become slightly short of breath when lifting furniture .
On the day of admission , when he fell , the patient was experiencing no chest pain , no shortness of breath , and had no loss of consciousness , no head trauma with fall .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
No fevers or chills , no chest pain , no shortness of breath .
The patient has stable three-pillow orthopnea and occasional paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
He has a chronic cough with clear sputum .
No hemoptysis , hematemesis , abdominal pain , black or tarry stools , dysuria / frequency/urgency .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
1. ORTHOPEDICS :
The patient has a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .
He is status post a hemiarthroplasty on 10/17/97 .
He received Ancef preoperatively .
Physical Therapy has been seeing the patient and putting him through passive external rotation to the neutral position of the left shoulder and forward flexion with physical therapy assistance .
Brittle bones were noted during the operation .
A bone density scan would be recommended as an outpatient , in order to evaluate this .
2. NEUROLOGICAL :
The patient has right facial droop , right ptosis , stable and present for greater than one year .
3. CARDIOVASCULAR :
No chest pain , no shortness of breath , 1+ ankle edema .
The patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction , given his fall at the airport and bigeminy seen on electrocardiogram that he developed during conscious sedation during reduction of the fracture .
Cardiology was consulted and aspirin and beta blocker added to his regimen , as well as chest wall nitroglycerin around the time of surgery , which was subsequently discontinued .
An adenosine SESTAMIBI was performed on 10/12/97 , which showed a negative electrocardiogram for ischemia and cardiac perfusion scans , with a moderate-sized , dense , fixed inferior defect indicative of scar .
A small / moderate-sized , mild-intensity , reversible posterior lateral defect was also seen , indicative of mild / moderate ischemia .
An echocardiogram was performed on Columbus Day which showed an ejection fraction of 50% , left atrial enlargement , thickening of the aortic wall consistent with atherosclerotic changes , left ventricle size , and systolic function within normal limits .
Cardiac monitor was placed on the patient , given the bigeminy , and he did rule out for myocardial infarction .
Cardiology recommended that in addition to the medications already stated above , his hematocrit be kept greater than 30 .
After his procedure on 10/17/97 , elevated CPKs were noted on 10/19/97 to 10/20/97 , and the first level was 744 , CPK # 2 635 , and CPK # 3 461 .
MB fractionations of the CPKs were all negative and were thought to be secondary to the patient &apos;s beginning physical therapy on 10/19/97 , and all muscular in origin .
4. GASTROENTEROLOGY :
GI was consulted on 10/15/97 for melena , decreased hematocrit prior to his humeral fixation surgery .
Upper endoscopy x 2 were done .
The first was on 10/15/97 , which showed clotted blood in the esophagus .
The stomach had evidence of prior surgery and old blood in the stomach .
It was thought that the blood in the esophagus was secondary to a possible Mallory-Weiss tear .
A second endoscopy was also performed several days later , in order to rule out a gastric ulcer , and also because the patient had had another episode of melena .
A gastric ulcer was found and this was biopsied and pathology is pending at this time .
This report needs to be followed up , and will be available at Bri Health in the Pathology Department some time within the next three to seven days .
The patient also needs a repeat endoscopy and a GI follow-up appointment inapproximately two months .
I have spoken with the patient in detail , and he will be getting in touch with his primary-care physician , Dr. Fordwoodall Stick , in Ranegei Pkwy , Verertliet , South Carolina 62156 .
The patient is to arrange follow up with a GI doctor in Jotar Boulevard , Cunahtampfordama , South Dakota 62848 through his primary-care physician .
The patient was initially on Cimetidine and Carafate here at Bri Health , and then switched to Prilosec 20 mg bid .
5. PULMONARY :
The patient &apos;s admitting chest x-ray showed an elevated left hemidiaphragm consistent with atelectasis versus splinting on that side .
Incentive spirometry was started .
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers were done .
The patient received chest physical therapy bid .
6. ENDOCRINE :
The patient needs still better diabetes control .
He has been somewhat noncompliant with his diet ( eating Pringle &apos;s in the room ) .
His NPH was recently increased today ( 10/23/97 ) to 24 units in the a.m. and 14 units in the p.m. with CZI sliding-scale coverage .
7. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient urinalysis on 10/19/97 showed moderate occult blood , pH 5 , albumin 1+ , white blood cells present , 2-50 red blood cell , 10-20 white blood cells , few bacteria , and moderate bladder epithelial cells .
Floxin 200 mg po bid was begun .
However , his urine culture from the same day remained negative , and this was discontinued two days later .
A repeat urinalysis on 10/22/97 was negative .
8. RENAL :
After the patient &apos;s procedure , he was felt to be volume overloaded .
He was given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 and also had Nitro paste around the time of his surgery and beta blocker .
The patient became slightly hypotensive on the night of 10/18/97 with systolic blood pressures in the 80s to 90s.
His BUN/ creatinine rose from 16/1.2 on 10/18/97 to 25/1.9 on 10/18/97 to 22/9.1 to today &apos;s labs , which are 15/0.7 on 10/23/97 .
9. HEMATOLOGY :
The patient transfused 2 units on 10/15/97 for a hematocrit of 27.6 .
The patient transfused 2 units of 10/16/97 for a hematocrit of 30.03 .
The patient transfused 1 unit on 10/18/97 for a hematocrit of 29.4 .
The patient transfused 1 unit on 10/19/97 for a hematocrit of 27.9 .
The patient transfused 2 units on 10/20/97 for a hematocrit of 28.2.10 .
FEN :
Repleting potassium , magnesium , phosphorus as needed .
The patient was noted to be slightly hyponatremic over the past few days , with sodiums in the 128-132 range , but this was secondary to elevated glucose fingerstick blood sugars ."

01/20/1996
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has a history four years ago of being admitted to the Etearal Etsystems/ Hospital after suffering an acute anterior myocardial infarction .
The course had multiple complications requiring pressors .
He had a cardiac catheterization performed which revealed a three vessel coronary artery disease with an occluded RCA , 70%-80% proximal LAD , and a high grade left circumflex lesion after the OM with distal left circumflex occlusion .
The patient was subsequently medically management after this hospitalization and has done very well .
His most recent echocardiogram in April of 1995 showed an ejection fraction of 20% with a thin fibrotic septum with akinesis and moderately severe hypokinesis in all other regions except for the lateral wall .
The patient also had an electrocardiogram in April of 1995 which was negative following , however was at a low workload .
The patient &apos;s was most recently admitted to Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center on Martin Luther King Day after becoming acutely short of breath after a five minute walk .
He had no chest pain , palpitations , diaphoresis , or nausea .
He called the EMT &apos;s and was found to be in pulmonary edema by chest x-ray at Centdick Naco Hospital Medical Center .
He was diuresed and ruled out for myocardial infarction .
His ECG showed no ischemic changes .
He was then transferred to the Retelk County Medical Center for further management .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for further management of his pulmonary edema .
It was felt that the patient possibly had a worsening of his coronary artery disease and therefore underwent cardiac catheterization on 01/17/96 .
At cardiac catheterization he had an RA pressure of 8 , an RV pressure of 52/10 , PA pressure of 60/25 , and wedge of 26 .
His coronary arteries revealed an 80% stenosis and a large OM .
The dominant left circumflex was occluded with left-to-left filling .
He also had a 50% LAD stenosis , a 100% large DT stenosis and a nondominant RCA with left RCA collaterals .
It was felt that this cardiac catheterization was not significantly changed from his previous catheterization .
Given his high right-sided filling pressure , he was started on Lasix for diuresis and his Captopril was increased for greater afterload reduction .
It was felt that the patient should have an augmented medical regimen and as an outpatient undergo an exercise tolerance test with viability evaluation to determine whether he would benefit from revascularization .
He was restarted on Coumadin for his low ejection fraction and started on diuresis with IV Lasix for two days and then switched to an oral Lasix regimen ."

She brought by EMS to Nantucket Cottage Hospital for furher evaluation .
Brief Hospital Course :
The patient was admitted to Nantucket Cottage Hospital on 2013-03-27 following a motor vehicle crash as described previously .
Chest and pelvis X-rays were negative for fractures .
A CT of her head demonstrated intraparenchymal and extraaxial blood ( mostly subarachnoid ) in bilateral cerebral hemispheres , right greater than left , in a pattern indicating contrecoup injury .
A CT of her C-spine revealed a possible fracture of right C7 pedicle .
A CT of her chest revealed bliateral lung nodules and a right thyroid nodule .
A CT of her sinues revealed no fractures .
X-rays of her right lower extremity were negative for any acute injury .
A neurosurgery consult was obtained .
Our recommendations were to load her with Dilantin and then continue at 100 mg PO TID .
The orthopedics spine service saw her and put her in a C-collar .
She was admitted to the trauma ICU .
A repeat head CT 12 hours after the first was largely unchanged .
She was transferred to step down .
She was having some pain issues and morphine was making her "" jittery .""
On HD 2 she was switched to Fioricet , which helped with her headaches .
A repeact head CT was unchanged .
An MRI of her C-spine was done to evaluate for ligamentous injury , but this was extremely limited examination due to patient motion and the signal in the spinal cord could not be adequately assessed for edema .
As per CMED CSRU spine , the patient was instructed to follow-up in 2 weeks for repeat X-rays .
On discharge she was awake , alert and orientated X3 with c/o mild headache .
She had full strength motor exam , no pronator drift and PERRLA with full EOM s.
She was ambulating without difficulties .
On 04-01 she was seen by physical therapy was thought to benefit from acute rehabilitation .
She had a head CT prior to discharge that showed resolution of the subarachnoid hemorrhage .
Follow-up in 1 month with neurosurgery for a repeat head CT was arranged .
She was discharged on fioricet and dilantin .
She was counseled to follow-up with her PCP F 6-12 months regading the right thyroid nodule and the bilateral small lung nodules seen on her chest CT ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 31-year-old right-handed female with right-sided greater than left-sided weakness and difficulty walking for several days .
She was in her usual state of health until 3/20/97 when she experienced the fairly sudden onset of predominantly right-sided arm and leg weakness and ataxia .
She was standing and walking with her friend , who &quot; had to catch her from falling down &quot; as she toppled towards the right .
She evidently recovered from the episode after a number of minutes .
The following day , she remained in bed through essentially all of the day due to malaise with no specific deficits being noted .
In the subsequent two days , she had several small spells of &quot; imbalance &quot; , particularly towards the right , and other symptoms included diffuse and mainly frontal headaches and mild neck soreness .
There was no diplopia , visual loss , speech abnormality or sensory change in her history .
She was initially evaluated at an outside hospital emergency room , and then transferred to Well General Hospital .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted for her gait disorder with other notable findings on examination including anisocoria , which , by the patient &apos;s report , had been noted several months earlier .
A magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiogram study was obtained , which showed no clear evidence of arterial dissections or infarction or other pathologic processes .
She had been placed on heparin initially , but this was discontinued after the magnetic resonance imaging results were obtained .
Posterior transcranial Doppler studies showed normal studies of both vertebral arteries , and carotid non-invasive studies showed normal right and left carotid bifurcations .
On the second hospital day , her gait continued to be markedly unstable , although with no consistent pattern in terms of weakness or directionality of falling , and she continued to have no reproducible upper extremity or lower extremity ataxia or dysmetria .
She was seen by the Psychiatry Service .
She was not felt to be acutely suicidal or otherwise in need of acute psychiatric treatment .
The psychiatrist also noted the indifference the patient evinced regarding her own symptomatology .
The patient was evaluated in one of the neurology conferences for several hours , and during this time , showed significant improvement while receiving gait training as well as evaluation ; in particular , she became more stable with counter-balancing methods .
This trend of improvement continued , and she was discharged in stable condition .
She will follow up with her psychiatrist , Dr. Freiermchird ( Sone Memorial Hospital ) on a regular basis , and she can follow up with the Neurology Service on a p.r.n. basis if needed .
She will continue on her previous outpatient medical regimen .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 49 year old man who was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit status post cardiac arrest .
History was obtained per the Emergency Department report as well as from the patient 's family .
Information was very limited regarding the circumstances of his cardiac arrest .
Reportedly , the patient was at a local restaurant where he was noted to be unresponsive .
EMS was called and reported to arrive on scene within three minutes .
The patient was asystolic but regained a perfusing rhythm after 2 mg of Epinephrine and 2 mg of Atropine .
He was intubated in the field and brought to the Emergency Department .
He remained unresponsive despite the administration of Narcan .
CT examinations of the head , chest , abdomen and pelvis were all unremarkable .
Initial chest x-ray showed a left retrocardiac opacity and prominent interstitium though his lung volumes were low .
Subsequent chest x-ray showed right main stem intubation with left lung collapse which had corrected with withdrawal of the endotracheal tube .
The patient was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for induced hypothermia given his hemodynamic stability , ongoing unresponsiveness and recent out of hospital cardiac arrest .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Cardiac arrest - His arrest was of unknown etiology at the time of admission .
No further history was ever gained about his cardiac arrest throughout his hospitalization .
CT angiogram had been negative for pulmonary embolism .
The patient had an echocardiogram on 2013-04-26 , which showed a normal ejection fraction and trivial mitral regurgitation ; otherwise no obvious abnormalities were seen .
Given the patient had an out of hospital arrest , remained unresponsive despite hemodynamic stability , he was treated with induced hypothermia and with cold packs and a cooling blanket were placed with goals of reducing his core body temperature to 32 degrees Celsius for a period of twelve hours at which point he would be rewarmed over the subsequent six hours .
This was done , however , as in problem number two below , we were not successful in any neurologic recovery .
Neurology - The patient remained unresponsive after the induced hypothermia , the patient was noticed to develop myoclonic jerks and occasional fluttering of his eyelids .
Electroencephalogram revealed the patient was experiencing persistent seizure activity .
Neurology was consulted and the patient was treated very aggressively , loaded with multiple drugs , including Ativan and Propofol drips .
The patient continued to demonstrate seizure activity despite this .
He was loaded with Dilantin and ultimately was treated with a Pentobarb coma .
After multiple attempts of weaning the Pentobarb , the patient was continually reverting to status epilepticus which was never able to be suppressed .
Infectious disease - Over the course of his hospital stay , the patient 's white blood cell count rose to a peak of 17 .
Multiple cultures were done and the patient was ultimately found to have methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia , pneumonia , and urinary tract infection .
For all these infections , the patient was treated with Vancomycin and he was also on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia at the time of his admission .
Blood cultures cleared by 2013-05-03 .
Sputum culture as late as 2013-05-10 , however was still positive for coagulase positive Staphylococcus which was methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus .
The patient remained gravely ill throughout his hospital stay and had multiple meetings were held with his family with his son being his next of kin .
Ultimately it was decided that the patient 's wishes would be to not be maintained in a vegetative state and given his poor prognosis ultimately the decision was made to pursue comfort measures only .
With these goals of care , the patient expired on 2013-05-11 .
The family did consent to a postmortem examination ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 61 - year-old white male with a history of coronary artery disease , status post 5-vessel coronary artery bypass graft on 2009-09-11 , who presents for elective right heart catheterization and pericardiocentesis .
The patient did well after his coronary artery bypass graft .
On 10-14 , the patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed a new , moderate-to-large sized pericardial effusion .
The patient was asymptomatic at this time , and the decision was made to monitor him and to start him on Lasix .
The patient had follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram on 11-04 which revealed a slightly large effusion .
A few days later , on 11-07 , the patient began to develop dyspnea on exertion with normal activity .
He also noted a new two to three-pillow orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
On 11-08 , he had an episode of acute shortness of breath with chest pressure which he describes as different from his typical angina with minimal exertion .
The patient spoke with his cardiologist who referred him for pericardiocentesis for persistent and symptomatic pericardial effusion .
On right heart catheterization , the patient was noted to have elevated right-sided and left-sided filling pressures with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 19 and a right atrial pressure of 16 .
After 600 cc of serosanguineous pericardial fluid was removed , the patient was noted to have a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 9 and a right atrial pressure of 2 ; indicating resolution of tamponade physiology .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit after his therapeutic pericardiocentesis .
He was hemodynamically stable and without any complaints .
He was continued on his home cardiac regimen , but was started on indomethacin for post pericardiotomy syndrome .
Over the course of the night the patient drained an additional 400 cc of serosanguineous fluid from his pericardial drain pouch .
By the next morning , the degree of drainage had decreased considerably with only 60 cc drained over six hours .
The patient had a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram prior to drain removal which revealed the following :
A trivial / physiologic pericardial effusion one day post pericardiocentesis with no change from the study immediately post pericardiocentesis .
The pericardial drain was removed without any difficulty .
The pericardial fluid bag was removed without any difficulty with the decision to monitor the patient overnight and repeat the echocardiogram prior to discharge .
The patient had an enlarged left pleural effusion which was noted to layer on a lateral decubitus film .
We decided to perform a therapeutic thoracentesis .
The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion , and 1150 cc of fluid were drained .
A chest x-ray was obtained post thoracentesis which revealed a significant decrease in the size of the left pleural effusion .
No evidence of pneumothorax .
On the morning of admission the patient had a markedly improved lung examination with increased air movement in the left base .
He denied any shortness of breath and had oxygen saturations in the 90 s on room air .
He had a repeat echocardiogram which revealed a trivial / physiologic pericardial effusion .
The patient was without any complaints and remained stable ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 44 year-old right handed woman with Down &apos;s syndrome who presents with increased falling and gait unsteadiness and an increased inability to perform her activities of daily living over the past three years .
The diagnosis of Alzheimer &apos;s was made in 1998 .
The patient had an MRI at an outside hospital which showed enlarged lateral ventricles and the possible diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus was entertained and the patient was admitted for diagnostic lumbar puncture .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Arkzie- Memorial for lumbar puncture .
On the night of admission lumbar puncture was attempted on the floor , but we were unable to get cerebral spinal fluid due to difficulty with compliance with the patient who was severely agitated and would not comply with the examination .
On hospital day the patient underwent conscious sedation in the operating room where lumbar puncture was performed .
Opening pressure was 17 and approximately 20-25 cc of CSF was removed .
CSF was notable for sugar level of 65 and total protein level of 56 .
OTHER LABORATORIES THAT WERE NOTABLE :
Vitamin B12 of 855 , folic acid of 15.4 .
Chem-7 was within normal limits .
Tube and requisition of the CSF labeled tube # 1 was notable for color pink , turbidity slight , xanthochromia yes , red blood cells 3,800 , white blood cells 3 , neutrophils 58 , bands 4 , lymphs 29 , monos 6 , eos 2 and basos 1 .
CSF tube labeled # 4 was notable for CSF color pink , CSF turbidity slight , CSF xanthochromia yes , CSF RBCs 3,900 , CSF white blood cells 3 , CSF neutrophils 61 , CSF bands 3 , CSF lymphs 31 , CSF monos 1 , CSF eos 3 , CSF basos 1 .
CSF gram stain was notable for no polys and no organisms seen .
The fluid culture was no growth to date .
One day prior to lumbar puncture , an aerobic culture was similarly pending .
Lyme capture was pending and at the time of discharge .
Other notable tests :
RPR card test was negative .
Because of poor compliance with the gait examination it was very difficult to assess changing gait post lumbar puncture .
The patient &apos;s gait remained wide based and shuffling and requiring assist .
Her mental status remained similarly to her admission examination .
The patient was discharged to home on 11/15/02 with instructions to the family to observe her gait in her home environment and to observe her behavior in her home environment over the next day and to report back to the primary neurologist , Dr. Flythegach , as to changes ."

Discharge Date :
06/22/1991
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Patient is a 28 year old gravida IV , para 2 with metastatic cervical cancer admitted with a question of malignant pericardial effusion .
Patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy in 02/90 for a 4x3.6x2 cm cervical mass felt to be a fibroid at Vanor .
Pathology revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with spots of vaginal margins and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the cardinal ligaments with extensive lymphatic invasion .
Patient was felt to have stage 2B disease and post-operatively , she was treated with intracavitary and external beam radiation therapy and low dose Cisplatin .
On ultrasound in 02/91 , the patient was found to have bilateral cystic adnexal masses confirmed on physical examination .
She underwent exploratory laparotomy and had a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .
Pathology was negative for tumor and showed peritubal and periovarian adhesions .
The patient now presents with a three to four week history of shortness of breath and a dry non-productive cough .
She was evaluated by Dr. Mielke , a Pulmonologist , who found her to be wheezing and performed pulmonary function tests which showed an FEV1 of 1.1 and an FVC of 1.8 .
She was admitted to Weekscook University Medical Center with a diagnosis of possible asthma .
Room air arterial blood gas showed a pO2 of 56 , a pCO2 of 35 , and a pH of 7.52 .
EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 100 and echo revealed pericardial effusion , a 10 mm pulsus paradoxus was noted , and no evidence of tamponade .
Given the patient &apos;s history of cervical cancer , the pericardial effusion was felt most likely to be malignant .
She was therefore transferred to the Retelk County Medical Center for further care .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for a new pericardial effusion which was felt most likely to be secondary to metastatic cervical cancer .
There was no evidence of tamponade .
An echocardiogram was scheduled and Cardiology was consulted .
Echocardiogram showed moderate anterior pericardial effusion of approximately 600 cc with diastolic indications of the right ventricle and low velocity paradox .
Cardiology did not feel that tamponade at this time was a concern and that a tap need not be performed .
She continued to have pulmonary wheezing , unknown origin , without history of asthma .
Her steroids were tapered and Pulmonary was consulted who recommended a CT scan of the chest to evaluate the lung parenchyma , induce sputum for CBC , arterial blood gas , continuing of the beta agonist inhalers , and trial of steroid inhalers .
They felt it was most likely a malignant lymphangitic spread with pericardial involvement versus infectious , other cardiovascular causes , or viral bronchiolitis .
She had pulmonary function tests repeated which showed an FEV1 of 36% of predicted and FVC of 56% of predicted .
Room air arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.45 , pO2 of 63 , a pCO2 of 41 , and fairly significant AA gradient .
She was continued on two liters of oxygen awaiting her CT scan on 06/14 and she developed a new junctional rhythm with a question of a new rub versus murmur on examination .
Cardiology felt she had a rub and her pulsus was still 10 .
EKG showed an ectopic low atrial P and they thought she was still stable without evidence of tamponade .
She should have a follow-up echocardiogram .
Echocardiogram showed left ventricle at the upper limits of normal for size , low normal function , moderate to mild effusion with pericardial pressures exceeding right atrial pressures , and right ventricular pressures at various points of patient &apos;s cycle without any change in the effusion from 06/11 .
Thoracic Surgery was also consulted and they felt that there was no need for a pericardial window at the time .
She should be continued with pulmonary oximetry testing .
She underwent her CT scan .
This showed lymphangitic spread of cancer in the chest , question of pulmonary nodules in the chest , pericardial effusion , multiple liver metastases , decreased function of the left kidney , dilated left intrarenal collecting system and proximal ureter , and periaortic lymphadenopathy .
Pulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that a bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time .
Chemotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer was discussed with the patient and she was started on 5-FU 800 mg per meter squared days 06/18 , 06/19 , and 06/20 .
She also received Cisplatin 35 per meter squared on 06/19 and Ifex and Mesna on 06/18 .
She was noted , on 06/16 , to have numerous erythematous maculopapules on her back and chest .
Dermatology was consulted and they felt that this was most likely steroid acne .
They therefore felt a rapid steroid taper was indicated and topical Erythromycin if desired by the patient .
The patient &apos;s shortness of breath and wheezing continued but without change .
Her cardiac examination remained the same and there continued to be no evidence of tamponade .
Cardiology felt that follow-up echo was indicated on 06/18 as she had another echocardiogram which showed no change or evidence of tamponade .
They therefore felt that she could be continued to be followed by examination .
She had some mental status changes with confusion and hallucinations on 06/18 originating from narcotics versus decreased pO2 .
The Ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the mental status changes and that she was to receive no further Ifex .
She had no further hallucinations since stopping the Ifex .
Psychiatry was also consulted to help her with the changes she was feeling since her new diagnosis .
She was hooked up with support services in Collot Ln , Dugo , Indiana 68961 for further counselling and given Xanax for symptoms of anxiety .
She continued to have no change in her shortness of breath or cardiac examination and was discharged home on 06/22/91 after completing her 5-FU and Cisplatin chemotherapy ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 61 - year-old Caucasian-speaking woman with a history of hypercholesterolemia and tobacco use who developed waxing and waning left substernal chest pain with radiation to the left shoulder on 2011-11-17 which lasted that entire day .
Upon waking on the morning of admission , she had 10/10 chest pain associated with nausea .
She presented to Charlton Memorial Hospital Hospital Emergency Department with inferior ST elevations ; at which time she became acutely hypotensive to a systolic blood pressure of 70 to 80 after receiving one ublingual nitroglycerin .
She then became bradycardic which responded to atropine and intravenous fluids .
In addition , she was given aspirin , Plavix , heparin , and morphine .
Immediately prior to transfer to Worcester State Hospital , she went into ventricular fibrillation arrest at 12:30 p.m. , at which time she was intubated and defibrillated back to sinus rhythm after five shocks .
She received an amiodarone bolus of 150 mg intravenously and was continued on an amiodarone drip while CMED CSRU-flighted to Boston Regional Medical Center_ where she underwent a catheterization .
The cardiac catheterization revealed a total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery and diffuse right coronary artery disease .
She received three stents to the right coronary artery which was complicated by a proximal dissection .
She had good post percutaneous coronary intervention angiographic results .
Incidentally , an aortogram during the catheterization revealed a Debakey class I aortic ascending aneurysm , and the patient had a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 20 at the time of catheterization .
She was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit in stable condition and still intubated .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM :
On the night of admission , the patient experienced post catheterization hypotension which required intravenous fluids and dopamine .
Electrocardiogram the following morning revealed normalization of her ST segments with evolution of Q waves .
Her dopamine was weaned off the following day , and her heparin was discontinued secondary to a right groin hematoma which had developed after the sheath had been pulled out by the fellow .
Her creatine kinases climbed ; reaching a peak of 3523 , which was down to 1500 at the time of discharge .
Also noted on the day of 11-20 , the patient self-extubated herself .
For her coronary artery disease , status post catheterization , she was given Integrilin for 18 hours .
She was continued on aspirin , Plavix , and Lipitor .
For her rhythm , amiodarone was discontinued as she was maintained in sinus rhythm after moving to the floor .
For pump , once transferred out of the Coronary Care Unit on 2011-11-20 , a beta blocker was begun at 12.5 mg of Lopressor p.o. b.i.d. which was titrated to 25 mg at the time of discharge .
Also , at the time of discharge , for increased afterload reduction , she was started on lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
On 2011-11-21 , the patient experienced atypical chest pain which was made worse with inspiration and movement .
It was not associated with any nausea or vomiting .
It did not radiate .
It was felt to be pain secondary to her self-extubation and noncardiac chest pain .
An electrocardiogram was checked which revealed no ST changes , and there was no increase in her downward trending creatine phosphokinases .
No further intervention was done .
The patient was treated with Tylenol orally as well as Ativan for anxiety that she had about going home .
She was pain free on the day of discharge .
Regarding her aortic ascending aneurysm , Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted regarding further workup .
At their request , a CT scan of the chest with contrast was performed on the day of discharge .
Dr. Streeter from Cardiothoracic Surgery will follow up with the patient for further management in approximately one month as an outpatient .
His office will contact her to make that appointment .
2. PULMONARY SYSTEM :
As stated above , the patient self-extubated herself .
She complained of a sore throat which was likely the etiology of her atypical chest complaints .
This resolved with Tylenol and as needed doses of oxycodone .
Her lungs remained clear to auscultation bilaterally throughout the remainder of her hospital course .
At the time of this dictation , the CT of her chest was still pending .
The official result was not yet in .
3. FLUIDS / ELECTROLYTES / NUTRITION :
The patient 's electrolytes sere managed daily and repleted on an as needed basis .
She did receive intravenous K-Phos for a low phosphorous of 1.5 .

10-29 she was transfused another 3U PRBC 's with hct bump to 31.9 and antibiotic coverage broadend to Unasyn , Ceftriaxone , Flagyl because she continued to spike , and for SBP prophylaxis .
Preprocedure of PTC on 10-30 she was transfused 1 unit PRBC 's, 2 platelets and 2U FFP and procedure went without complication .
ON transfer to the floor she remained hemodynamically stable with stable Hct and declining bilirubin .
She remained afebrile so on 11-02 antibiotic regimen was weaned to only levofloxacin .
Liver teams recommended to repeat EGD with non latex banding in 7-10 days .
She also went home on naldolol 20 mg qd for portal htn , and her home doses of diuretics to control her ascites .
2. US finding - Pt was incidentally found to have R hydronephrosis and a R adenexal mass on her US .
The hydronephrosis was likely caused by blockage by her tumor .
Given her disease prognosis and the fact that her other kidney is functioning well , no intervention was done .
Also the adenexal mass may represent a second primary maligancy .
This was seen on a prior CT scan and her oncologist is aware .
Again given the patient 's poor disease prognosis , there was no intervention made at this time ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 88 year-old woman undergoing treatment for a right lower extremity cellulitis who was transferred from Child for worsening cellulitis and new confusion .
The patient has a history of severe aortic stenosis and was recently admitted to the Retelk County Medical Center for a Nafcillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus cellulitis of the right leg treated with a course of Nafcillin and Levofloxacin .
There was also a right leg fluid collection that was incised and drained on August 1 , 1998 .
The patient was sent to rehabilitation on Levofloxacin orally .
Although details were not available at the time of admission , apparently , she had done well until the 24 hours proceeding admission when the cellulitis was felt to be worsening .
She had also been noted to be confused and combative during that 24 hour period .
As her baseline mental status is completely alert and oriented , this caused concern amongst the staff of the rehabilitation center and the patient was transferred to the Retelk County Medical Center .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1) Mental status changes :
On admission to the emergency room , the patient was somewhat argumentative and confused as well as uncooperative with procedures .
A neurologic work-up was undertaken which included a CT scan of the head which revealed no acute bleed and a lumbar puncture which revealed a glucose of 72 , protein 65 , white blood cell count 19 , red blood cell count 11,500 with no evidence of xanthrochromasia .
The Neurology Service evaluated the patient who felt that her agitation was most likely due to infection , her multiple medications , or her metabolic condition .
The patient &apos;s mental status slowly began to recover , however on the morning of the first day of admission , August 16 , 1998 , the patient was found after having fallen .
A neurological examination was performed which revealed no abnormality and imaging included a head scan which revealed no bleed and a cervical spine series which revealed degenerative joint disease but no obvious fracture .
The patient decided not to pursue further testing with a neck CT scan .
At the time of discharge , the patient &apos;s mental status is back to its baseline .
2) Right lower extremity cellulitis :
The patient was evaluated by the Surgical Service who felt that the wound was clean with some erythema but without evidence of true cellulitis .
The patient &apos;s antibiotics were discontinued with the thought that prolonged antibiotics only put her at more risk for infection .
3) Cardiac :
The patient has a history of critical aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation .
Fortunately , these issues were not active during the present admission .
4) Status post fall :
The patient did fall while inhouse .
A head CT scan and cervical spine series were negative .
The patient appeared to have no deficits at the time of discharge .
5) Atrial fibrillation :
The patient &apos;s Coumadin was continued .
6) Abnormal liver function tests :
On admission , the patient was noted to have elevated bilirubins in the 3 range and mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase consistent with a cholestatic picture .
These liver function tests will be followed closely as an outpatient ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Saujule Study is a 77-year-old woman with a history of obesity and hypertension who presents with increased shortness of breath x 5 days .
Her shortness of breath has been progressive over the last 2-3 years .
She has an associated dry cough but no fevers , chills , or leg pain .
She has dyspnea on exertion .
She ambulates with walker and a cane secondary to osteoarthritis .
She becomes short of breath just by getting up from her chair and can only walk 2-3 steps on a flat surface .
She feels light headed when getting up .
Her shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion has been progressive for the past several years .
It has not been sudden or acute .
She sleeps in a chair up right for the last 2 1/2 years secondary to osteoarthritis .
She has orthopnea as well but noparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
She occasionally feels chest twinges which are nonradiating but are sharp .
They last a few seconds on the left side and are not associated with sweating , nausea , vomiting or syncope .
She has had lower extremity edema for thelast several years with multiple episodes of cellulitis .
Her lower extremity edema has increased for the several weeks prior to admission secondary to an inability to elevate her legs due to a broken chair at home .
She denies any pleural chest pain .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Negative for headaches , vision changes , numbness , tingling , dyspnea , hematuria , abdominal pain , diarrhea , melena or hematochezia .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital for acute and chronic shortness of breath .
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient was found to be in congestive heart failure and thought likely secondary to diastolic dysfunction secondary to hypertension .
The patient was also found to have pulmonary hypertension .
She ruled out for myocardial infarction with 3 negative enzymes .
On admission , she was diuresed with Lasix and was negative 1-2 liters per day for several days .
The diuresis was backed off when her bicarbonate increased from 36 to 39 .
She was restarted on 20 mg p.o. q day prior to discharge .
Her lipids were checked with a total cholesterol of 110 , triglycerides 59 , HDL32 , LDL 64 .
The patient had a D-dimer greater than 1000 with lower extremity non-invasive studies which were positive for a small right common femoral clot .
It was unclear whether this was old or new .
A TTE showed an ejection fraction of 60% , mild mitral regurgitation , left atrial enlargement , mild tricuspid regurgitation , pulmonary artery pressures of 44 plus right atrial pressure .
There was an intra-atrial shunt from the right to the left through a patent foramen ovale .
Chest CT was a poor study but did not show a pulmonary embolus .
The patient had subsequent dobutamine MIBI which was positive for inducible ischemia in the distribution of posterior descending coronary artery and posterolateral coronary artery with a small to medium perfusion defect in the inferolateral wall and basal inferior wall which was partially reversible .
The cardiology service saw the patient and recommended medical management only without catheterization .
Her blood pressure was high so Captopril was titrated up to 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. .
She will be discharged on Lisinopril with further titration as an outpatient .
She is on hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q day .
Her atenolol was stopped due to bradycardia on admission but this may be restarted as an outpatient in gentle doses with careful monitoring of heart rate .
She is on an aspirin .
She will be discharged on Lasix 20 mg for continued control of her edema .
2. Pulmonary ;
Pulmonary hypertension as seen on echocardiogram .
Unclear whether there are chronic pulmonary embolus but did have positive test for deep venous thrombosis and will be treated with Coumadin .
An ABG was done which showed pH 7.34 , pCO2 78 , pO2 92 on 2 liters .
Her bicarbonate peaked at 39 and generally is in the 36-38 range .
She has severe sleep apnea and falls asleep midsentence .
She has episodes of not breathing .
BIPAP was attempted for 3 nights in a row and the patient did not tolerate this .
She will need pulmonary function studies as an outpatient as these were not done in the hospital .
The pulmonary team saw the patient and only recommended the above testing .
She needs home oxygen and is currently at 2 liters nasal cannula oxygen .
3. Infectious disease :
Evidence for cellulitis on her legs , likely due to distention from edema and poor perfusion .
She was originally started on cefazolin which was then changed to Keflex with good improvement .
She will need to continue for at least 10 more days or as clinically indicated by the course of her cellulitis .
4. Hematology :
D-dimer in the emergency room was greater than 1000 and a right common femoral clot was seen .
This clot was small and it was questionable as to whether it was old or new .
She was started on anticoagulation given the positive D-dimer .
Chest CT was nondiagnostic but did not show pulmonary embolus .
It was a poor study .
Heparin was maintained during her hospital course and then Lovenox was started .
Her dose was increased to 7.5 mg q day the day prior to discharge .
She will be discharged on this dose in addition to 1 day of Lovenox .
Discharge INR 1.8 .
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 .
5. Fluids / electrolytes / nutrition :

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 55-year-old female with multiple prior admissions for pneumonia , COPD , asthma exacerbation , over 3 weeks of upper respiratory like infection unremitting with increased nebulizer treatments at home .
The patient saw her PCP and was known to have an oxygen saturation of 82 to 85 percent on room air .
She was referred to the Emergency Department .
In the Emergency Department , the patient received Zithromax , ceftriaxone , and Flagyl .
Chest x-ray was remarkable for a questionable left lower lobe infiltrate .
The patient received nebulizer treatment with oxygen saturations increasing up to 98 percent on room air .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Shortness of breath .
The patient was maintained on albuterol nebulizer treatments and Ipratropium nebulizer treatments , as this was apparently thought to be related to her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Given the presence of consolidation on chest x-ray , however , and previous history of pneumonia , the patient was maintained on antibiotics of Zithromax 500 mg daily and ceftriaxone .
The patient was also started on Solu-Medrol IV for active airway disease component of her shortness of breath .
The patient was maintained on supplemental oxygen and sputum production was maximized with the help of an Acapella device and respiratory therapy .
Mucomyst was also considered as a mucolytic component towards secretions .
Adrenal insufficiency .
The patient was maintained on IV Solu - Medrol 60 mg q. 8 h.
Chest soreness .
The patient describes chest discomfort without any significant EKG changes .
The patient was maintained on Percocet p.r.n. for pain relief .
This was thought to be related to musculoskeletal .
There was no evidence of acute rib factors on her chest x-ray .
GI .
The patient was maintained on PPI for reflux disease and known gastritis .
CMED .
The patient has a history of neurogenic bladder and , therefore , she required a Foley catheterization .
Endocrine .
The patient was on Levoxyl at home as her home dose for hyperthyroidism .
CMED CSRU transfer .
The patient was transferred on the evening of 2012-05-22 to the ICU given persistent carbon dioxide retention and respiratory acidosis and the intermittent mental status changes .
The patient had had ABG on the floor , which prompted her to transfer to the ICU .
Her pH was 7.23 , PCO2 73 , PO2 146 on a nonrebreather .
The patient had BiPAP initiated once she reached the unit , but did not tolerate it , becoming apneic and obstructing .
The patient was switched to 2 liters nasal cannula and oxygen saturating at 98 to 100 percent .
After BiPAP was initiated , the patient became hypotensive down to 75/28 and bradycardiac , responding to 3 fluid boluses over the course of the night .
The patient was started on Florinef for concern of adrenal insufficiency ; however , she was hemodynamically stable that morning and was transferred back out to the floor .
It was thought that the patient may have been mucous plugging during her stay in the ICU .
Hematologic .
The patient has a history of high MCV and megaloblastic cells on smear in the setting of anemia ; question B12 deficiency , the patient also has a history of borderline low B12 levels .
The patient was diagnosed for B12 deficiency due to her long history of poor p.o. intake .
Methylmalonic acid levels were sent , the results are pending at the time of discharge ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 58 year old female with a history of Parkinson &apos;s disease for more than twenty years who presented to the Gemenadentoolpai Medical Center with a revolving anterolateral wall myocardial infarction on 08-01-93 .
She has been under the care of Dr. Aalv Manual and was referred here for further therapy .
She had no prior significant cardiac history and presented to her local medical doctor &apos;s office with an episode of severe retrosternal chest pain .
Her electrocardiogram showed a new right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock .
The patient was transferred to the Gemenadentoolpai Medical Center and was admitted .
Her hospital course was remarkable for ruling in for a myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 9,379 units with a 5.9% MB fraction .
In addition , on telemetry she developed complete heart block and hypotension requiring temporary pacing wire and then a permanent pacemaker implantation on 08-03-93 .
She developed congestive heart failure and required pressor support .
She underwent cardiac catheterization on 8-15-93 and was found to have a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 28 millimeters of mercury .
She had a dominant right coronary artery with minor disease .
The main left coronary artery had a 20% stenosis .
The left anterior descending had a severe 80% proximal stenosis with a filling defect consistent with intraluminal thrombus .
The circumflex artery had a minor 40% stenosis .
Cine left ventriculogram revealed a dilated left ventricle with an area of anterolateral , apical , and septal akinesis .
The left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to 38% .
The patient was transferred to the Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center for consideration of coronary angioplasty .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
Her risk factors for coronary artery disease included a positive family history and an elevated cholesterol level .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Medical Service .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Department because of the history of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
The patient was maintained on intravenous heparin .
On 8-17-93 , she was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where she underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the proximal left anterior descending .
Following balloon angioplasty , there was a local dissection with evidence of intraluminal thrombus , with a greater than 10% loss in the initial gain following coronary angioplasty .
Therefore , directional coronary atherectomy was performed with an excellent angiographic outcome , and a less than 10% residual narrowing .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
She was maintained on intravenous heparin and was brought back to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on 08-18-93 for a relook coronary angiography .
Coronary angiography demonstrated ongoing benefit of the initial coronary atherectomy .
Specifically , there was no decrease in the initial gain that she achieved after directional atherectomy .
The patient remained stable during the rest of the hospitalization .
She was transferred in stable condition to the Pasi for further rehabilitation therapy .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 59-year-old white male .
The patient has had multiple myeloma since 1990 .
He underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant in 10/92 at Petersly Hospital And Medical Center .
At that time he received total body irradiation of 1400 cGy .
This bone marrow transplant did not produce remission and then he was treated with three cycles of VAD subsequently .
In 08/94 , the patient developed lower back pain .
A workup done in DE is not available at the time of this dictation .
According to her scanty records , an MRI of the spine showed diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in T4 and T8 with no cord compression at that time .
He was then treated with radiation therapy from T3 to T9 receiving 2500 cGy from 08/94 to 09/94 .
He has been on Decadron since 08/94 .
About two weeks prior to admission the patient developed mid back pain , burning in nature with radiation around the right lower ribs .
He also began to develop noticeably increasing bilateral lower extremity weakness and possibly numbness in the lower extremities .
He stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair .
An MRI without gadolinium done on 11/20/94 of the spine showed a right posterior lateral epidural mass extending from T9 to T12 .
There was evidence of cord compression .
The patient &apos;s Decadron dose was increased to 12 mg q day and he was also started on MS Contin and radiation therapy was being planned and arranged at the Petersly Hospital And Medical Center .
However , one day prior to admission the patient developed right lower extremity pain and could not walk secondary to the pain .
Over the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital , the patient &apos;s right lower extremity became red , swollen , and increasingly painful .
He has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the right lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased .
He also complained of some fecal incontinence the day prior to admission without urinary incontinence .
At the time of presentation the patient denied headache , arm weakness , changes in vision , dysarthria , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or shortness of breath .
He was taken to Huyychestleme Health Of in Scoo , Utah where he had a temperature of 99.9 , blood pressure 90/50 , heart rate 128 , and O2 sat of 91% on room air .
Blood cultures , urine culture , and UA were all done .
Blood cultures drawn on admission subsequently grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
He was treated with Ceftazidime , gentamicin , and Vancomycin and also was started on a Dopamine drip for treatment of his sepsis .
A Swan was placed and initial readings were CVP of 6 , wedge pressure of 10 to 12 , cardiac index of 4.7 , and SVR of 438 all consistent with a Pseudomonas sepsis picture .
He was given stress steroids and was subsequently transferred to Lorough Medical Center &apos;s Intensive Care Unit for further management .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By problems -
1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE / CELLULITIS :
The patient &apos;s clinical situation was most consistent with a Pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis .
Blood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out Pseudomonas that was sensitive to Imipenem and Tobramycin .
There were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at Retelk County Medical Center and those also grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
The organism grown at this institution was sensitive to Imipenem , Ceftazidime , Amikacin , gentamicin , Ciprofloxacin , Tobramycin but was resistant to Cefotetan , Ceftriaxone , Mezlocillin , Bactrim , Ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and sulbactam .
He was treated initially with Ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism &apos;s susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital .
He was subsequently switched to Imipenem and Tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course .
The Tobramycin and Imipenem were started on 11/25/94 .
In addition , the patient received a five day course of intravenous IgG to improve infection control .
Vancomycin was also added to his regimen on 11/28/94 and this was primarily to provide improved MRSA coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity .
He was evaluated by the Surgery Department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time .
He is being maintained with twice daily Xeroform with Betadine changes .
These dressing changes are applied by applying the Xeroform on Betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages .
Of note , the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes .
The plan is to complete a full course of Imipenem and Tobramycin for his Pseudomonas cellulitis .
As mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh .
The cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient was initially treated with Dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved .
He was noted to be in rapid AF on several episodes receiving 5 mg IV Lopressor each time with improvement .
He has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm .
An echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global EF .
The patient is being maintained on Digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
He has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization .
The plan is to continue the Digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better .
3) ONCOLOGY :
The patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine .
He has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay .
The plan is to complete a full course of XRT to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma .
The patient &apos;s lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the MRI appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy .
4) NEUROLOGIC :
As mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids .
He was initially treated with IV Decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h.
His neurological exam remained stable with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema .
His Decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg IV q6h on 12/3/94 .
His Decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely .
5) BLOOD SUGARS :
The patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus .
He has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving NPH in the morning and night in addition to a CZI sliding scale on a q6h basis .
The plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high .
6) RESPIRATORY :
He initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% .
However , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his O2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% .
He can be given intravenous Lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema .
7) NUTRITION :
The patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia .
He has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued .
He should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained .
8) ELEVATED PT and PTT :
Both of these responded to three day course of vitamin K 10 mg each day .
His PT and PTT are now normal , however , he continues to run a low platelet count .
This has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant .
We have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk .
He also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his Hct around 30 .
Thrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 70 year old gravida IV , para 4 who presented for a vaginal hysterectomy secondary to uterine prolapse and also presented for evaluation of a suspicious lesion seen on a mammogram .
Patient &apos;s problem started four years ago when she first experienced a pushing forward of her uterus .
The patient described this sensation as uncomfortable and becoming more prominent over the following three years with increasing pressure and pain .
Two months ago , the patient slipped and fell with valsalva that precipitated an exacerbation of her prolapse .
She subsequently could not urinate and was in pain secondary to her problem .
At this time , she decided that she needed the prolapse fixed and actually wrote to the Norri Hospital to try and find a Gynecologist .
Her letter was referred to Dr. Earllamarg Para who saw her in the office and recommended vaginal hysterectomy .
Patient has never had a pessary and refused one and denies nausea , fever , chills , dysuria , or stress incontinence on her current admission .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Cardiology was consulted to evaluate this and felt that the changes seen on the EKG were not significant .
The patient was also seen by Dr. Nusc from General Surgery for evaluation of micro calcifications in the right breast .
The patient refused a biopsy for this admission and desires follow-up mammograms .
She is to be followed up by General Surgery .
The patient underwent a total vaginal hysterectomy on June 4 , 1993 which she tolerated without complications .
Her post-operative course has been uncomplicated .
She remained afebrile throughout her admission tolerating a regular diet by post-operative day two and was discharged on June 6 , 1993 with Percocet for pain .
The Foley was discontinued and the patient was urinating on her own ."

The patient is a 91 yo woman with h/o HTN who came from Bridgewater State Hospital Rehab with substernal chest pain after exercise .
Pt had been in her usual state of health and performed here regular exercises .
After returning to her room she w noted SSCP without radiation .
No nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis .
They did an ECG at Bridgewater State Hospital rehab which demonstarted new ST depressions in V1-V4 .
She received ASA 81 mg x 2 and nitro SL x 2 with partial relief at nursing home .
On presentation to Providence Behavioral Health Hospital Amanda , her vitals were HR 68 , BP 142/68 , RR 28 , O2 sat 100% RA .
Exam was notable for RRR with no murmur , bibasilar crackles , guaiac negative .
EKG showed sinus brady , with old LAD and new ST depressions in V1-V4 .
Troponin was 0.07 .
She received ASA , nitro SL then gtt , morphine , metoprolol , and heparin gtt .
Cardiology discussed cath however , patient 's family turned down .
Transferred to CCU for further management and observation .
Brief Hospital Course:
INITIAL IMPRESSION :
90 year-old woman with h/o of HTN p/w substernal chest pain shortly after exercise at nursing home , with EKG showing ST depressions in V1-V4 and troponin 0.07.
Likely NSTEMI .
.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
.
* CV :
The patient 's family refused coronary artery catheterization .
The patient was given ASA , Plavix , heparin drip x 24 hours , nitro drip , atorvastatin , metoprolol , and lisinopril .
Her chest pain was controlled with morphine .
Her SBP remained in the 160s-170s on hospital day 1 and she was gently diuresed .
On hospital day 2 she experienced atrial fibrillation with HR in the 140s .
Her metoprolol dose was increased from 25 mg PO bid to 50 mg PO bid then 75 mg PO tid .
Her HR decreased to 70s-80s .
Her BP remained stable .
An ECHO showed that she had preserved EF and no wall motion abnormalities .
We decided given her age that she would not be a good candidate for cardioversion for her afib nor would she be a good candidate for coumadin .
Therefore we will continue rate control with metoprolol this can be titrated if needed , and aspirin and plavix for anti-coagulation .
She should also continue on lipitor and lisinopril .
She should have her chem 7 checked next week given the start of her new meds .
Will also need LFT 's checked in 3-6 months .
.
* Pulmonary :
Bilateral crackles at bases and midlungs , elevated JVP , trace bilateral ankle edema , and CXR with diffuse opacities suggest possible pulmonary edema , likely secondary to acute MI .
Her O2 sat was stable at 94-97% on 2.5L of supplemental O2 .
She experienced no respiratory difficulty during the hospital stay .
She was diuresed small amount .
Her CXR prior to discharge showed mild pulm edema and thus was given 40 of lasix prior to going to rehab .
She can be given prn lasix for weight gain or shortness of breath .
.
* Leukocytosis- She developed mild elevated WBC .
UA had 12-14
WBC 's , few bacteria .
She was initially started on Bactrim , but this was stopped as she was afebrile .
SHe has a culture pending which needs to be followed up at the nursing home and treated if positive .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 83-year-old female who presents for surgical evaluation for her hyperparathyroidism .
This is an 83-year-old female with a history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy , status post mitral valve replacement in 1988 , chronic atrial fibrillation , hypertension , who presents for parathyroidectomy .
In August of 1996 while the patient was at Retelk County Medical Center for replacement of her knees bilaterally , and on preoperative evaluation she was noted to have a high calcium and therefore the surgery was canceled .
Further testing revealed hyperparathyroidism as evidenced by an elevated PTH .
The patient reports no masses in her neck .
She has noticed some generalized hoarseness in her voice for the past 5-6 months .
In addition , she has some dysphagia , particularly has had some difficulties with swallowing .
She has been seen by Dr. Tokbelb , her primary care physician in Itgreenredan Hospital , and also Dr. Kotefyfechird , her cardiologist , and also an endocrinologist at Retelk County Medical Center .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
On the day of admission , the patient was brought to the operating room for parathyroidectomy .
The right superior parathyroid gland was found to be markedly enlarged and consistent with an adenoma .
Her right superior parathyroid gland was removed and the rest of her parathyroid glands were left in place .
Postoperatively , the patient did well and was able to cough and phonate completely with no changes from preoperative .
The plan was to start her on heparin and Coumadin and discontinue her heparin when her Coumadin levels became therapeutic as judged by the prothrombin time / INR .
However , on postoperative day number two , the patient in the afternoon noticed some tingling in her hands and also some tingling hear her perioral region .
She had a negative Chvostek &apos;s and negative Trousseau &apos;s sign .
She had no muscular weakness noted .
An ionized calcium was drawn which was low at 1.0 .
As a result , the patient was started on Os-Cal 250 mg PO q.i.d. On postoperative day number three , her ionized calcium was 1.06 and her Os-Cal was increased to 500 q.i.d.
However , her ionized calcium decreased to 0.97 and she was given one amp of calcium gluconate .
On postoperative day number five , the patient felt fine and had an INR of 1.9 with a prothrombin time of 16.6 .
Her calcium was 8.5 , albumin 3.6 , and phosphate 4.5 .
She had had no further episodes of tingling in her fingers after the initial episode which had prompted us originally to draw the ionized calcium ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. Breunlinke is a 69 year-old right handed woman , status post surgical correction of a C-1 to C-2 dural AVM in January , 1998 , now presenting with a one month history of increasing left sided weakness and pain with spasticity , occasional difficulty swallowing and abdominal pain .
She was originally admitted to the Verg Medical Center in January , 1998 , because of a one year history of left sided weakness and spasticity .
She was found to have intermedullary lesion at C1-2 level which on biopsy showed abnormal vasculature , hemosiderin deposit , leading in turn to the discovery of a dural arteriovenous malformation at that level which was surgically corrected .
The postoperative period was complicated by transient swallowing difficulty , increasing left sided weakness and urinary retention .
She was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation where she made significant progress toward recovery .
As of the beginning of September , 1999 , she was able to swallow without difficulty , urinate without difficulty ( although bowel movements have been problematic ) .
Functionally , she was at the level of pre-gait training and able to stand and take several steps with upper body support .
Over the past 4-5 weeks her functional level has progressively deteriorated .
She is now unable to stand and needs assistance to sit up .
Her left arm has developed a flexure contraction and she reports intermitttent pain in the left arm and leg which occurs both spontaneously and is also triggered by contact .
She has developed some new swallowing difficulty and since her transfer to a long term inpatient care facility , she has lost ten pounds .
She denies dysuria or excessive urinary frequency .
Over the past several weeks she has also developed severe intermittent abdominal pain , localized to the suprapubic area , left greater than right , occurring intermittently .
The patient feels this is secondary to her hemorrhoids , although it does not clearly localize to the rectum .
This pain often follows bowel movement but does occur spontaneously .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On admission , a CT scan of the head with and without contrast was performed , showing a missing posterior arch at C-1 and metallic clips at the craniocervical junction consistent with prior surgical intervention .
No arteriovenous malformations are identified ; there is no evidence of recurrence of her former vascular malformation .
No intraspinal lesions are identified .
Upon further review of Dr. Laymie Fields , Department of Neuroradiology , review of the cervical spine on CT reveals no extrinsic compressive lesions impacting the spinal cord and no enhancing lesions of the spinal cord with contrast .
Angiography performed on October 31 , 1999 , showed normal vascular distribution of the head and neck with no recurrence of arteriovenous malformation .
During this admission , the patient was started on Baclofen 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. for spasticity .
Coumadin was discontinued .
The patient was given aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
The patient was also given Valium 5-10 mg p.o. t.i.d. for muscle spasm .
She was continued on Demerol 50 mg q 6-8 hours p.r.n. for left arm and leg pain .
Upon further review of CT and angiography results with Neuroradiology and Neurology service , it was decided that CT myelography was not indicated at this time .
Note , the patient is not a candidate for magnetic resonance imaging secondary to ferromagnetic intracardiac pacing device ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Robert Mackey is a 49 year old gentleman with a 22 year history of diabetes mellitus .
He has a history of peripheral neuropathy , kidney transplantation in 2003 secondary to diabetic nephropathy , as well as throat cancer in 2004 treated with local resection and radical neck dissection on the left as well as postoperative radiation .
Mr.. Mackey also had signs and symptoms consistent with cervical myelopathy ; a cervical MRI scan showed very impressive disc herniations at C5-C6 , less so at C4-C5 , with clear cut cord compression , particularly on the right side C5-C6 .
Therefore , he was admitted for C4-C5 and C5-C6 anterior diskectomy with autologous bone graft and instrumented fusion .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
While in the PACU , Anesthesia was called because the patient became dyspneic and tachypneic and his SAO2 dropped to 89% .
His respiratory rate was 30 on face mask .
Interoperatively , he was positive two liters with a stable blood pressure and heart rate , although requiring some neo-synephrine interoperatively .
He responded to intravenous Lasix with 3.2 liters of urine output as well as marked clinical improvement .
The etiology for his congestive heart failure was determined likely to be diastolic dysfunction from increased heart rate as well as excess volume .
No definite evidence for significant myocardial ischemia , although cardiac enzymes were sent and he ruled out for myocardial infarction .
He was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where his respiratory and cardiac status was monitored carefully .
He was given Lasix to continue to diurese the excess volume .
He was also put on Lopressor 150 mg twice a day .
Also in the Intensive Care Unit , O2 saturation was closely monitored .
The patient became agitated with both tent and Bi-PAP machine , although continued to saturate well .
He was transferred to Medicine the morning of 2010-08-30 , for continued medical management post surgery .
On the day of transfer , the patient was noted to be confused with waxing and waning sensorium ; thus , a delirium work-up was initiated looking for precipitants .
1. When his O2 saturation was monitored , his pulse oximetry remained in the 90s during his stay .
2. His non-essential medications that may have been contributing to his change in mental status were discontinued ; those included Temocillin , Nortriptyline , Haldol , Lorazepam , Venlafaxine , Bupropion , and Gabapentin .
In addition , his cyclosporin levels were checked .
3. Hypo or hyperglycemia :
Mahoney had been following with their appreciated recommendations on glucose control .
Finger sticks were in the 150 s when acutely agitated , therefore , it was not determined that glucose levels were contributory .
4. Infectious causes were evaluated .
He was febrile in the Intensive Care Unit to 101.0 F. ; yet , chest x-ray , blood cultures , urinalysis and urine cultures were all negative for sources .
A lumbar puncture was considered , although not performed due to the fact that the cerebrospinal fluid was not breached during the procedure .
5. Mass effect was considered , although no focal deficits were ever noted on examination and due to the fluctuating sensorium , it was determined that there was no severe underlying structural abnormality .
A head and neck CT scan , non-contrast , were ordered though to evaluate for such processes .
No acute intracranial hemorrhages or midline shifts were noted , although a soft tissue mass was noted at the level of C2 .
This was determined to be within the normal expected changes post surgery .
6. Trauma was also considered .
The patient was found out of bed but no signs of head trauma , no loss of consciousness .
Throughout his stay , Chem-10 was monitored .
There were no electrolytes or mineral abnormalities that could explain his delirium .
Liver function tests were checked , only total bilirubin was slightly elevated at 1.6 .
TSH was within normal limits as was B12 and folate .
RPR evaluating for possible neurologic syphilis was also checked .
The assay was nonreactive .
An EEG was also considered to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus , although again this did not seem to be a likely cause .
On the evening of the 22nd , the patient became acutely agitated , threatening to leave , and also threatening to harm those nurses and physicians that were attempting to prevent him from leaving .
Security was notified who then arrived to the room and helped to place the patient in four-point restraints , for the safety of both the patient and the staff of the hospital .
The restraints were weaned off overnight although he became acutely agitated and they were replaced early on 08-31 .
Later in the morning on 08-31 , the patient was more oriented and alert , and asked to have the restraints removed .
They were taken off two at a time .
The patient continued to do well and did not require restraints after that event .
Intramuscular as well as intravenous Haldol were ordered p.r.n. for emergency use should he become acutely agitated .
haldol as well as the restraints were not required after the morning of the 23rd .
Each progressive day , Mr. Donald delirium abated with return to baseline mental status early on 09-01 .
The likely cause of the delirium was a combination of surgery and Intensive Care Unit stay in addition to poly-pharmacy .
Other concerns during his stay was his kidney function , due to his renal transplant in 2003 .
His immunosuppressive therapy was continued throughout his stay ; his creatinine remained approximately 2.3 to 2.4 ; he has a baseline renal insufficiency .
With this in mind , when obtaining a CT scan it was determined that contrast would not be the best option .
While the patient was in restraints , gentle hydration was initiated since p.o. intake was not adequate .
As for his diabetes mellitus , the Mahoney Team provided updated recommendations each day , adjusting for the changing p.o. intake .
The only other complaints from Mr. Mackey during his stay were :
Soreness at his operative sites , for which he was given p.r.n. Tylenol once his delirium had resolved .
In addition , he also complained of difficulty with swallowing , necessitating only soft and liquid diet .
This was attributed to postoperative swelling and changes from his diskectomy performed 2010-08-27 ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 38-year-old gentleman , Spanish-speaking , from the Taheimpromong , with no significant past medical history , who presents with shortness of breath x 2 months as well as a dry cough x 1 month .
The patient was in his usual state of health until two months prior to admission when he began to notice shortness of breath on climbing flights of stairs .
He stated that this became worse over the last month until he was noted to be short of breath at rest .
He also states that he has had a dry and nonproductive cough for one month .
He denied any fevers , chills , or night sweats .
No nausea , vomiting , or diarrhea .
He did note some weight loss over the past several months , though the amount was unknown .
He denied any contact with TB positive patients .
He describes a negative PPD one year prior to admission when he was in prison for one week .
He did travel to the Taheimpromong , last in 01/2004 for three weeks .
He did note multiple female sexual partners , although described using condoms except with his wife .
He denies any IV drug use , did describe cocaine use last two months ago .
He did drink alcohol three drinks per day , no withdrawal symptoms .
In emergency room , he was noted to be afebrile with stable vital signs , was treated with IV fluids , azithromycin , and cefuroxime .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
1. Pulmonary / Infectious Disease :
The patient &apos;s differential diagnosis included initially a question of an atypical pneumonia or PCP .
His PPD has been negative one year prior to admission , PPD was rechecked during this admission and was negative .
He was ruled out for tuberculosis with an induced sputum x 3 , which showed no AFB .
Chest CT showed bibasilar diffuse infiltrates , PCP was negative .
Thus initially he had been started on prednisone and Bactrim , this was discontinued .
He was continued on azithromycin and cefuroxime until bronchoscopy results were known , negative .
Thus they were discontinued .
He initially had refused HIV testing , however , was finally consented , HIV was noted to be negative .
Pulmonary consult was invited , initially the patient refused bronchoscopy , however , did agree to it during his hospital stay .
The results were negative for Micro , most likely diagnosis as per review of pathology is organizing pneumonia with possible diagnosis of BOOP and chronic inhalational injury was a possibility .
The patient required supplemental oxygen to keep his oxygen saturation greater than 93% .
Ambulatory saturation was 82% on room air .
He was treated with supportive medical therapy for his cough .
He was to follow up with pulmonary as an outpatient .
2. Cardiovascular :
Echocardiogram was checked to rule out CHF , showed LVH and trace TR , ejection fraction of 60% without any pulmonary hypertension .
3. Heme
/ID :
Hepatitis serologies were negative .
4. FEN :
The patient was kept on a house diet .
His electrolytes were repeated p.r.n.
5. Prophylaxis :
Lovenox .
6. Code status :
Full .
7. Disposition :
The patient was discharged to home in satisfactory condition with home oxygen .
Multiple conversations were had with the patient as well as an interpreter stating the importance of not smoking and keeping flames away from his oxygen tank .
He was sent home with LDAMC services to help with his medications as well as oxygen education .
He was told to call a doctor or come to the emergency room should he have any further troubles , breathing , chest pain , or fevers .
He was to follow up with Dr. Malta at Firmert Hospital on 07/23/04 at 3:00 p.m. , as well as Dr. Shawn Leick at the Stonho Health Care pulmonary division as directed ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 69 year-old white gentleman who is status post a coronary artery bypass graft in 1985 with a large anterior septal myocardial infarction intraoperatively .
Two years after this operation , he required a pacer implantation for sick sinus syndrome .
The patient presents now with progressive dyspnea , but no anginal pain .
Ejection fraction was noted to be 20% .
He is status post multiple angioplasty stents .
He presents now for possible reoperative coronary artery bypass graft .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Verg Medical Center .
Subsequent exercise treadmill test demonstrated no evidence of ischemia by EKG .
The patient was subsequently taken to the operating room where he underwent a reoperative coronary artery bypass graft times three with a subaortic proximal graft from the aorta to the OM1 and then OM2 and aorta to the LAD with a wide graft per Dr. Lumar Jongguild .
Postoperatively , the patient was ventilated .
The patient was weaned off an Epinephrine drip .
Rhythm became more stable .
Balloon was weaned and finally discontinued .
The patient was extubated .
His Melranon was weaned off and his ACE inhibitor began .
The patient was started on Amiodarone and diuresed .
The patient &apos;s lower extremities began to swell and the patient was begun on Hirudin for deep venous thrombosis .
The patient &apos;s heparin induced thrombocytopenia became positive and so he is allergic to heparin .
The patient was begun on Coumadin and he stayed several days for Coumadinization and was finally discharged on therapeutic Coumadin .
The patient tolerated a regular diet on postoperative day number thirteen from his reoperative coronary artery bypass graft ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Breutzfarstxei is a 30 year old man with recently diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who presented with pneumonia , developed adult respiratory distress syndrome , and died in the hospital after failed efforts of ventilatory support .
Mr. Breutzfarstxei was recently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when he had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on 01/17/91 .
He was admitted to the Retelk County Medical Center at that time and was treated with Bactrim and steroids .
He was actually intubated and underwent bronchoscopy where the diagnosis was made with a positive toluidine blue study .
He initially did well after extubation and completed approximately two weeks of Bactrim and a steroid taper .
At discharge after about two weeks post-extubation , he had an O2 saturation of approximately 95% on room air .
He was seen by Dr. Seen and Dr. Seen as an out-patient .
On 02/06/91 , he was seen in FLFDMC and at that point , his temperature was noted to be 101.4 and he had malaise and diarrhea .
He was evaluated in the Emergency Room .
At that time , his oxygen saturation was only 90% on room air and his chest X-Ray showed no change .
Cultures were taken and he was sent out .
On 02/08/91 , the patient called Dr. Seen because of increased shortness of breath and malaise .
He was seen in FLFDMC where he was noted to have jaundice and newly palpable liver edge .
Review of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the Bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway .
His oxygen saturation at that time was only 86% on room air and he was admitted .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for work-up of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work-up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both .
In terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a Bactrim failure for PCP although this was unusual .
He was started on Pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to Bactrim .
The patient was also covered with Erythromycin and Gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods .
He was given supplemental oxygen .
In terms of his liver abnormalities , it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that Bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities .
Titers for CMV and Epstein-Barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent .
Stool was sent for ova and parasites .
Gastrointestinal was consulted .
Initially , the patient did well in terms of his pre-status and required less oxygen .
However , on 02/10/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .
Actually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that Pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of Erythromycin and Gentamicin , the patient &apos;s respiratory status worsened and his LDH climbed so he began Pentamidine on 02/10/91 .
On 02/11/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his O2 saturations , and was intubated on 02/11/91 .
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on 12/12/90 on Gentamicin , Vancomycin , Pentamidine , and Prednisone .
Also of note at that point , hepatitis C virus serologies had come back positive .
However , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 .
The patient &apos;s abdominal CT scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction .
The patient &apos;s liver function tests appeared to improve .
The patient &apos;s penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on Acyclovir .
On 02/13/91 , the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted .
No other cultures grew out and the patient &apos;s clinical status deteriorated .
The patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator .
He required elevated ventilatory pressures with PIPS often above 60 .
Fortunately , no evidence of baratroma was ever discerned .
However , the patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse I to E ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation .
Patient underwent liver biopsy on 02/16/91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died .
The patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1.75 , hematocrit as low as 26 , and platelets as low as 68 noted on 02/15/91 .
These were supported with blood products and Hematology was consulted .
They felt that it was most likely secondary to Bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died .
Bone marrow biopsy was not attempted .
Discussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care .
Due to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis , the family decided , in consultation with the Medical Team , to withdraw ventilatory support .
This was done on the evening of 02/18/91 .
Patient expired after the endotracheal tube was withdrawn at 6:40 p.m."

Discharge Date :
01/20/1991
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was in her usual state of excellent health until July of 1991 when she first noted a left clavicular mass .
Subsequently , the mass continued to increase in size .
On 12/23 , she was seen by Dr. Stonge at Bri Health where a 3 x 7 cm left mid clavicular mass was noted .
A fine needle aspirate of this mass reportedly revealed giant cell tumor .
The patient was initially told that this was a benign tumor and that it could simply be watched and definitively treated after the delivery of her baby .
Subsequently , the mass progressively increased in size and the patient had developed significant discomfort in this region .
On 1/5 , the patient underwent a local tumor debulking at Bri Health under local anesthesia .
The pathology , unfortunately , revealed an aggressive adenocarcinoma ( micropapillary type ; mucin producing ) .
This prompted further staging work-up .
The patient subsequently had a limited chest CT at Bri Health which showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases , metastases to the sternum , rib , multiple spinal levels ; internal mammary lymphadenopathy .
The poor prognosis for the patient and child were discussed and after the patient decided to have an elective abortion , an abdominal CT scan was obtained which revealed diffuse metastatic lesions of the liverspine , ribs and most of the lymph nodes .
There was no obvious GIor pancreatic tumor identified .
The patient had a very firm nodule at the vertex of her calvarium .
A specimen was obtained by fine needle aspiration and the pathology of this was consistent with adenocarcinoma .
The patient was transferred to Nimaconwood Valley Hospital for management of her cancer and termination of the pregnancy .
Over the past four weeks , the patient reported progressive shortness of breath and mid thoracic back pain .
She has had no motor weakness , abnormal sensation , numbness , tingling or incontinence of bowel or bladder .
She denied fevers , chills or sweats .
There has been no GI or GU symptoms except for constipation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient had an elective termination of her pregnancy on 1/13/91 .
The work-up for the extent of the patient &apos;s disease included MRI scan of the cervical and thoracic spine which revealed multiple metastatic lesions in the vertebral bodies ; a T3 lesion extending from the body to the right neural for amina with foraminal obstruction .
An epidural mass was present at T10 which was extending from the lamina or spinous process anteriorly and almost compressing the spinal cord .
An abdominal and pelvic CT scan with IV contrast revealed bilateral pulmonary nodules and bilateral pleural effusions , extensive liver metastases , narrowing of the intra hepatic IVC and distention of the azygous system suggestive of IVC obstruction by liver metastases ; ascites ; multiple bony metastases ; and an isolated splenic metastases .
A bone scan revealed increased uptake in the left chest wall , left anterior ribs four to six , and increased uptake in the left and right lateral skull in the area of the parotids .
Ahead CT scan revealed a metastatic lesion in the right vertex of the calvarium but no intracranial abnormalities .
Work-up for the source of the primary tumor which is still unknown included a mammogram which identified no suspicious microcalcifications and no dominant masses .
The abdominal and pelvic CT scans showed no suspicious GI masses , no pancreatic mass ; a 2 cm ovarian cyst .
The review of the pathology from Bri Health confirmed a high grade adenocarcinoma .
Erica and basic cystic protein stains are still pending .
Serum markers were normal .
The CEA was less than 0.7 .
The hCG on admission was 30,710 and on 1/19 was 805 .
The CA-125 was still pending and alphafeto protein is still pending .
Hypercalcemia :
The patient presented with a serum calcium of 11.8 and an albumin of 2.3 on admission .
She received three days of intravenous etidronate with normal saline diuresis and the serum calcium subsequently decreased to 9.0 .
The patient was then switched to po etidronate .
IVC obstruction :
The patient has extensive hepatic metastases and by CT scan there is obstruction of the intrahepatic IVC .
This has resulted in marked bilateral lower extremity and presacral edema with ascites .
The patient &apos;s low serum albumin is also contributing to her extensive edema .
Hypoxia and shortness of breath :
Although the patient &apos;s room air saturation was 96% during this admission , she subjectively complained of increased shortness of breath .
It was felt that the patient &apos;s extensive pulmonary metastases and bilateral pleural effusions resulted in increased work of respiration and a sensation of shortness of breath .
Impending spinal cord compression :
The patient had back pain on admission without any focal neurological signs .
The MRI scan on admission revealed an impending cord compression at the level of T10 .
She was started on Decadron and on 1/17 began the first of ten radiation treatments to two fields ( T2 to T5 and T9 to T11 ) .
Per the patient &apos;s wishes , Dr. Dalywoo Droreite the Windgo Hospital was consulted for a second opinion regarding the management of her malignancy .
Dr. Linke recommended chemotherapy with PFL .
Per the patient &apos;s wishes , she was transferred to the Windgo Hospital for chemotherapy .

The patient was a direct admission to the operating room on 02-12 , at which time she underwent an
aortic valve replacement .
Please see the operative report for full details .
In summary , she had an aortic valve replacement with a #21 mosaic porcine valve .
She tolerated the operation well , and was transferred from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit .
The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period , however , her blood pressure remained somewhat labile .
Therefore , she was continued on a Neo-Synephrine drip to maintain a systolic blood pressure greater than 110 .
In addition , she was slow to awaken after her anesthesia was reversed , and in several attempts to wean from the ventilator , she developed a respiratory acidosis .
She therefore remained on the ventilator throughout the day of postoperative day one .
On postoperative day two , the patient remained hemodynamically stable .
Her Neo-Synephrine drip was weaned to off .
She was again weaned from the ventilator , and successfully extubated .
Her chest tubes were discontinued and , at the end of the day , she was transferred from the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit to the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation .
After being transferred to the floor , the patient did well .
Over the next several days , her activity level was increased with the assistance of Physical Therapy and the nursing staff .
She remained hemodynamically stable .
Her respiratory condition remained stable and , on postoperative day four , she was deemed stable and ready to be transferred to rehabilitation for continuing postoperative care and physical therapy ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 52 year old Czech speaking gentleman with a history of severe mitral regurgitation .
For the past several years , the patient has continued to have significant exercise intolerance which has limited his ability to work .
He reports severe dyspnea on exertion .
The patient had a recent admission earlier in the month and he was discharged on 2015-09-10 , after undergoing cardiac catheterization .
This was significant for demonstrating no flow-limited disease in the coronaries but several fistulae
from the left anterior descending to the PA .
Several of these were coil embolized during this admission .
He tolerated this well , was sent home , and now returns for his mitral valve repair .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On the day of admission , the patient went to the Operating Room and underwent a minimally invasive
mitral valve repair .
He tolerated this procedure well .
The patient was brought to the cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on minimal pressor support .
He was successfully weaned off this support .
The patient was fully weaned from ventilatory support secondary to a persistent acidemia .
This was treated with sodium bicarbonate and a Swan-Ganz was placed to provide close hemodynamic monitoring .
The patient was found to have stable hemodynamics with appropriate mixed venous saturations in the 70% range .
The patient was corrected to a normal pH of 7.41 by the first postoperative night and remained stable .
He was then weaned off of ventilatory support and was successfully extubated .
The patient did have a slight bit of confusion early in post-extubation course which cleared .
This was also compounded by a language barrier since the patient cannot speak English .
In addition , the patient 's early postoperative course had a tremendous urine output .
It was equally up to 700 cc. an hour and a renal consultation was obtained .
He underwent a head CT scan to rule out intracranial pathology leading to diabetes insipidus .
This was negative .
The patient 's serum and urine electrolytes indicated that this diuresis was appropriate .
The patient 's urine output has decreased and his BUN and creatinine remained normal .
The patient 's Foley was discontinued .
He had developed some hematuria which has resolved .
The patient has remained stable and is now ready for discharge to home with follow-up in approximately four weeks ."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 61 year old male with a history of diabetes , coronary artery disease , hepatitis C , and asthma who was diagnosed recently with pancreatic cancer after he presented to Seph&apos;sju Memorial after a motor vehicle accident .
Chest CT revealed a pulmonary nodule .
Abdominal CT revealed a 3.0 to 4.0 centimeter lesion in the pancreatic head .
An ERCP performed there showed a long segment of distal narrowing of the common bileduct and a transhepatic biliary drain was placed there on December 29 .
On January 1 , a chest tube was placed for a loculated pleural effusion .
On January 2 , pleurodesis was performed .
On January 4 , he had a desaturation .
VQ was indeterminate .
LENIs were negative at that time .
On January 5 , he had a chest xray with a left apicalpneumothorax but was stable on chest xray of January 7 .
Brain CT was negative , as was a bronchoscopy with lavage .
His CA99 was normal .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
The patient had reported an approximately 30 pound weight loss in six weeks .
He had experienced some constipation for the few months prior with lighter colored stools , darkened urine and fatigue for months with increased shortness of breath , orthopnea and dyspnea on exertion .
He denied any fevers , chills or night sweats .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Gastrointestinal .
The patient had an elevated bilirubin on admission with decreased output of biliary drain .
The drain was replaced over the wire , 8-10 by IR , when it was accidentally removed .
Increased flow again .
The patient had signs and symptoms develop of SBP , also with an elevated white count .
He was treated broadly with amp , levo and Flagyl .
Cultures were negative and onlyon one gram stain did it show rare gram negative rods .
The patient &apos;s abdominal fluid cell counts showed 2400 white blood cells , 500 red cells with 82 polyps , 11 lymphs , 7 monos .
Clinically , this was consistent with SBP , although unfortunately , fluid was never sent for cytology and a lot of those white cells are most likely due to his cancer .
He underwent abdominal paracentesis approximately two times a week for therapeutic .
This had to be performed by IR because the pocket was too deep to access from the bedside .
He received a two week course of broad spectrum antibiotics and will be maintained on Levofloxacin IV for prophylaxis against SBP .
2. Pulmonary .
From a pulmonary standpoint , he continued to complain of shortness of breath .
His apical pneumothorax from the outside hospital had resolved .
Chest xray was consistent with pleurodesis .
However , with persistent abdomen distention , there is likely restrictive deficit and , in addition , after each tap , he at times became hypotensive and with some mild fluid resuscitation decompensated with pulmonary edema , requiring both albumin and Lasix to try to mobilize third space fluids .
On the day of discharge , he is stating approximately 91 to 92% on three to four liters .
Chest xray is still consistent with volume overload .
The plan will be to continue to try to alternate albumin and Lasix to mobilize his fluid .
3. Cardiovascular .
He had episodes of bradycardia without subsequent fall in blood pressure at the beginning of his admission .
He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
Echocardiogram showed 50% ejection fraction with mild mitral regurgitation .
He did not show any episodes of bradycardia throughout the remainder of his hospital course .
4. Endocrine .
Diabetes .
His Avandia was discontinued secondary to the side effect profile .
He is being maintained on glipizide and sliding scale insulin .
5. Heme .
From a heme standpoint , he presented anemic and with an elevated PT INR .
He required a few transfusions during his hospital course .
He also required FFP initially to reverse his coagulopathy .
However , this resolved on its own over the hospital course .
His INR normalized , however , unfortunately , he developed bilateral deep venous thromboses during his hospital course and will be maintained on Lovenox .
6. Renal .
He had a creatinine of 4.0 on admission and this decreased down to the mid ones with fluid , currently at 1.7 on discharge .
From his urinalysis , he has mostly a prerenal state .
However , he does require diuresis to prevent increased volume overload in his lungs from his hypoalbunemic state .
At the time , Nutrition was following , initially with a low fat , low cholesterol , low sugar diet .
His appetite is decreasing somewhat as his disease process progresses , therefore , we have liberalized his diet for him to take what he wishes .
7. ID .
Please see GI .
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for a 14 day course for clinical SBP .
He will be maintained on Levofloxacin for prophylaxis against SBP .
Given that he will need continued taps,
8. Oncology .
The patient initially came for workup of pancreatic cancer with a questions of palliative chemotherapy .
However , given his rapid clinical decline , this was deferred and I do not suspect that he will be a candidate for this , as the degree of his decline bodes a poor prognosis for him .
His pain here has been controlled , initially on Oxycontin with morphine for breakthrough pain .
As he becomes progressively more somnolent , this will likely need to be switched to IV pain medications only .
Discussion , at that point in time , should occur with the family about comfort measures and about weaning him from his medications to make him more comfortable .
Code status - the patient is a DNR / DNI .
This is an unfortunate case but Mr. Po does have an incredibly supportive family who have been here consistently to visit him and that offers him an important source of comfort ."

History of Present Illness :
Mr. Lockley is a 73 yo male with a complicated past medical history , recently discharged from St. Margaret 's Center for Women & Infants on 08-02 following a prolonged admission for STEMI , respiratory failure felt secondary to pulmonary edema requiring intubation and subsequent tracheostomy 02-22 failure to wean , sepsis and C.difficile colitis treated with Vancomycin and Flagyl with a course of Levophed .
He was discharged to Athol Memorial Hospital for continued weaning .
Per Dr. John C. Corrigan Mental Health Center , patient remained ventilator dependent , intermittently on PS 20/5 and back on AC 15/5/500/0.35 on 08-08 .
At OSH , sputum cultures grew Pseudomonas and MRSA , and he was restarted on Zosyn ( 08-08 ) and Vancomycin ( 08-09 ).
He completed his course of Vancomycin on 2017-08-10 .
However , today around 17:45 , while being moved by the nursing staff , Mr. Lockley Bosche started coughing .
Suctioned X 1 , mucus not cleared .
He then became dusky and cyanotic , and stopped breathing on his own .
A code was called , + pulse .
Patient placed on FiO2 100% .
Vitals reportedly HR 88-98 , BP 150/80 .
ABG done on FiO2 100% 7.36/66/417/98% .
At Vencor Hospital , BP dropped to 90 , and patient was started on NS IVF , with improvement in BP .
EKG without acute changes .
He was transferred to St. Margaret 's Center for Women & Infants John for further management on AC , RR 15 , PEEP 5 , Vt 500 , Fi02 1.0 .
In John , BP 80/60 , HR 80 .
Continued on IVF ( received total 2300 cc ) , with improved BP to SBP 105-118 .
Stool sent for C.diff and given Flagyl 500 mg PO X 1 dose .
Brief Hospital Course :
Mr. Lockley was admitted with respiratory failure , thought to be related to mucus plugging as well as a pseudomonal pneumonia .
Both of these etiologies were treated , and he continued to oxygenate and ventilate well on his usual ventilator settings .
However , the issue that dominated the admission was his recent acute decline in mental status .
He was thoroughly evaluated by neurology and underwent head CT , MRI , LP , and EEG .
This work-up demonstrated a small left basal ganglia infarct , likely cardioembolic .
However , they felt this event could not account for his new , severe global deficit ; this was thought to be secondary to a more pervasive process , likely anoxic encephalopathy , for which the prognosis is extremely grim .
This was discussed at length in several family meetings involving the patient 's wife , son , primary care doctor , ICU attending , and neurology consultant in the presence of a Asian interpreter .
The end result of these discussion was that the patient 's wishes would not be consistent with this new level of functioning from which he had little hope of recovery ; the family decided to make him comfort measures only .
He was disconnected from the ventilator and all medications beyond a morphine drip were stopped , and he expired shortly thereafter .
The family was present ."

Also , three years prior in 1993 , she had an attack of diverticulitis .
She has been worked up with barium enema in 09/97 which showed multiple diverticula throughout the colon , but mostly in the sigmoid .
At this time , there was diverticulosis with no acute diverticulitis .
There was also no obstruction .
The patient is also status post aortic valve replacement in 1996 , and presented for heparinization prior to her elective valve surgery .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and begun on cefotetan and Flagyl , as well as heparin .
Her INR dropped to 1.6 prior to surgery , and her PTT was in the mid 80s prior to surgery .
She was admitted and placed on a bowel prep two days before surgery and was taken to the Operating Room on hospital day # 3 , 10/28/97 .
At that time , she underwent sigmoid colectomy and ventral hernia repair . ( A full account of this operation can be found in the Operative Note ) .
She tolerated this procedure without complications initially and was taken to the Recovery Room in stable condition .
Postoperatively , she had her heparin restarted , and had a PTT rising to 142.8 and then down to 92 .
Her primary postoperative development was the passage of some blood clots and blood per rectum on postoperative day # 2 .
She continued to pass blood per rectum and was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells .
Her preoperative hematocrit was 41 and her hematocrit dropped to 30.4 on postoperative day # 2 .
This was a drop from an immediate postoperative hematocrit of 35.4 .
Upon receiving the one unit of red blood cells , her hematocrit returned to 33 , and in the two days subsequent to the transfusion , returned to 34 .
Otherwise , her postoperative course was uneventful with gradual resolution of the passage of blood per rectum .
Her heparin was discontinued when it was noted that she was bleeding per rectum and her PTT drifted to a normal range of 35 by postoperative day # 3 .
On postoperative day # 1 , the patient was restarted on 2 mg of Coumadin .
However , due to the episode of bleeding on postoperative day # 2 , the Coumadin was held for two consecutive days , and then restarted on postoperative day # 4 .

The patient &apos;s INR had dropped to 1.7 at the time of operation , and remained in this range initially , but began to rise to 2.0 with her Coumadin dosing .
At the time of discharge , it was 1.9 , for which she received 4 mg.
On the next day , it was 1.6 and she returned to a normal dosing of 4 mg followed by outpatient draws to determine the further Coumadin dosing .
This was postoperative day # 6 , at which time she is ready for discharge .
The rest of her hospital course was unremarkable , with perioperative ampicillin , gentamicin and Flagyl discontinued on postoperative day # 1 .
She had some initial nausea but had no emesis .
Her nasogastric tube was discontinued on postoperative day # 1 , and she tolerated a regular diet by postoperative day # 3 .
She had flatus and regular bowel movements by postoperative day # 5 .
She also complained of some slight dizziness upon getting up .
For this reason , her normal Lopressor and Norvasc were held .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Eugene is a 67 year old male with a remote history of chronic pancreatitis due to alcohol abuse 30 years ago , who is transferred now from Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital for an ERCP and work-up for a cystic lesion at the head of his pancreas on CT scan shown at the outside hospital .
The patient presented initially to Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital at the end of December for abdominal pain , and was found to have pancreatitis .
During this admission , two CT scans had shown a question of an enlargement of the head of his pancreas
versus early pseudocyst .
The patient was discharged home early from this admission due to family needs .
While at home , the patient did not do well and could tolerate minimal food intake and lost about 20 pounds in one month .
On an office visit on 01-14 , the patient was found to have significantly elevated alkaline phosphatase .
That evening , the patient again developed abdominal pain "" like his pancreatitis "" with nausea and vomiting , for which he was admitted to the Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital .
In the Emergency Department at the Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital , the patient was noted to have vomited some heme positive material .
His complete blood count showed 11% bandemia with a total white count of 10 .
A HIDA scan showed no flow , question of pancreatitis versus common bile duct obstruction .
His electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm .
A chest x-ray was unremarkable .
During his admission to Rehab Hospital of the Cape & Islands Hospital , the patient had dropped his hematocrit to the 30 s with recorded melena .
He received an MRCP which was negative for evidence of stones .
An ultrasound showed normal gallbladder with no wall thickening but a dilated common bile duct of 8 mm measured on CT scan .
The patient had an attempted ERCP on 01-18 , which was unsuccessful due to a long nipple like papilla .
He was therefore transferred to Saints Medical Center for endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography .
The patient 's blood cultures at outside hospital grew out Streptococcus sanguis-gordonii on 01-18 .
This was sensitive to Clindamycin , Erythromycin , penicillin S and Vancomycin .

Cardiac and infectious sources of hypotension were considered , but cardiac enzymes were not changed from prior studies and he had no localizing signs of infection ; blood cultures were sent and a ultrasound of the L arm AVF ordered to rule out abscess at the site .
He received a partial HD session , limited by hypotension .
Over night , his blood pressure trended up to 130 s systolic .
He was restarted on his home blood pressure regimen .
Renal consult team saw him 2019-01-20 and plan to next dialyze him on 2019-01-21 .
He was to be called out to the medical floor on 2019-01-20 but became somnolent after receiving pain and anti-nausea meds , so he stayed in the ICU for closer monitoring of respiratory status , which spontaneously improved .
His blood sugar at 10 pm was low at 22 and he was disoriented , which resolved with two glasses of juice ; he did not receive his standing dose of NPH that evening .
Blood cultures returned positive with GPC in pairs and clusters , so a TTE and surveillance cultures were ordered and vancomycin was started .
He was then called out to the medical floor on 01-21 .
Brief Hospital Course :
Pt admitted to medical floor in hemodynamically stable condition without specific complaints .
# hypertensive urgency :
Upon presentation it was unclear when last time was that patient took meds , but hypertension likely d/t inability to take meds in setting of N/V .
Also contribution of autonomic dysfunction .
No evidence of active end organ damage .
Pt was treated with labetalol gtt in CMED CCU which was weaned off on 01-20 .
carduac enzymes mildly elevated , felt 02-08 demand ischemia in setting of hypertensive urgency , CK and MB trended Mcewen at time of admission to medical floor .
Pt 's hypertensive urgency was resolved upon admission to the medical floor .
His SBP s ranged 140 s- 170 s .
He was restarted on his home regimen of antihypertensives without difficulty ( metoprolol 75 tid , clonidine patch and oral , nifedipine 30 SR q daily ).
he was discharged home with change in his regimen .
# bacteremia :
pt with 2/4 bottles coag neg staph on 01-19 and again on 01-20 .
PORT was felt most likely source , and pt has had at least 2 sets of + blood cultures since it was placed .
TTE was obtained which was not concerning for endocarditis .
pt without stigmata of SBE .
ID consult obtained which recommended removal of PORT , which was taken out on 01-23 .
Pt will compelete a 2 week course of vancomycin at hemodialysis , which has been arranged by renal service .
A PICC was breifly placed , however removed as it is unclear if pt can reliably flush this .
PORT will be replaced on 2019-02-11 per IR ( Dr. Welsh placed last PORT , then removed it on 01-23 ), ordered placed in OMR .
Indication :
diabetic gastropathy causing inability to toleral oral antihypertensive medication prompting repeated Donald presentation for hypertensive urgency .
Pt with surveillance cultures and port tip cultures showing NGTD on 01-24 , he will have futher surveillance cultures drawn at hemodialysis and followed by his nephrologist .

Denied nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , bowel movement changes .
She has noted increased urinary frequency .
Denies fever or chills .
Of note , she has had recent medication changes which included discontinuing Diovan and starting terazosin .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Medicine Service and treated for presumed diastolic and systolic dysfunction .
Echocardiogram was obtained which showed moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function as well as hypokinesis of the lower half of septum and apex .
Also of note was the distal lateral wall hypokinesis .
The wall motion abnormalities were noted to be new .
It was believed that a troponin on admission in addition to the wall motion abnormalities she underwent a non-Q wave myocardial infarction prior to resulted in her current cardiac failure .
Throughout hospital course patient 's troponin trended down to less than 0.3 .
Heart Failure Service was involved .
She was continued with aggressive diuresis .
She was started on _________ with excellent diuresis , however , her renal functioning worsening .
A cardiac catheterization was deferred until the renal issue could be resolved .

Diuresis was halted and without improvement in creatinine .
Renal was consulted .
A renal ultrasound was obtained .
It showed a right kidney size of 6.3 cm and a left kidney size of 8.4 cm .
Given her hypertension which was very difficult to control , it was felt that she had renal artery stenosis and thus she underwent MRA of the kidney which showed severe right renal artery stenosis at its origin .
There was also moderate to severe focal stenosis of the left renal artery approximately 1.3 cm from its origin .
Dr. ______________ consulted on the case .
She was transferred to the unit overnight to assess volume which was noted to be optimal .
On 05-25 she underwent catheterization and subsequent stenting of the left renal artery .
Due to dye load required to assess the coronary disease were not visualized .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 37-year-old female who presents on an elective basis for a living-related kidney transplant .
The patient has a history of end-stage renal failure secondary to type 1 diabetes with a baseline creatinine of around 5 .
She is receiving a kidney from her sister .
The patient has a history of hypertension , coronary artery disease , and insulin-dependent diabetes for 32 years .
She is status post myocardial infarction in April of this year and subsequently underwent coronary artery bypass surgery .
She present electively on the morning of her surgery with no recent changes in her medical problems .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the preoperative holding area and taken electively to the operating room .
She underwent a living-related renal transplant in the right iliac fossa .
The operation was somewhat technically difficult secondary to a short segment of ureter which was anastomosed over a stent to the bladder .
Otherwise , there were difficulties , and estimated blood loss was minimal .
She was taken postoperatively to the recovery room already making a large amount of urine .
Intraoperatively , for immunosuppression she received thymoglobulin and Solu-Medrol .
She was started on Prograf and CellCept in the postoperative period .
She was also maintained on Bactrim postoperatively and did not require ganciclovir , as she and her sister were cytomegalovirus negative .
The patient 's initial postoperative course was relatively uneventful .
Her creatinine , which was 5 initially postoperatively , slowly dropped over the next few days until eventually reaching a low of 1 .
She did receive pamidronate on postoperative day one and received a total of four doses thymoglobulin .
Her steroid doses were slowly tapered over her hospital course , and her Prograf level was adjusted to maintain therapeutic values between 10 and 15 .
She continued to make good urine over the first few days and had her urine losses replaced with intravenous fluids .
On postoperative day three , the patient had an episode of shortness of breath that was evaluated by both the Renal and surgical residents .
It was found that she was in acute pulmonary edema and required transfer to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
Her blood pressure at the time of this incident was in the range of 200/120 .
Her electrocardiogram showed no specific ST changes , but there was some loss of her R wave progression laterally .
Serial enzymes were drawn , and Cardiology was consulted .
With blood pressure control via a nitroglycerin drip and fluid restriction , the patient quickly improved and a had a relatively short stay in the Intensive Care Unit .
Throughout this time , her creatinine continued to drop , and there was no apparent deleterious effect on her transplant from this episode .
Her beta blocker was progressively increased , and her nitroglycerin drip was weaned down .
Two days after this event , she underwent an echocardiogram which was significant for slightly depressed left ventricular systolic function with severe posterior wall hypokinesis .
This was a change from her prior echocardiogram and demonstrated evidence of a small myocardial infarction .
Clinically , she did much better and her blood pressure was optimized prior to discharge .
She was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day five and was stable on the floor for the next two days ."

There were no intraoperative complications and the surgical field was hemostatic at the conclusion of the case ( see operative report for full description ) .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was stable in the PACU and admitted to the CMED CCU floor for routine care .
At 1645 12-04 , the patient was noted to be hypotensive to 70/40
HR 84 with symptoms of lightheadedness while lying supine .
There was no active bleeding noted at the surgical site on examination .
A STAT HCT drawn at this time was 31.2 .
The patient was re-evalutated at 2000 and was found to be tacchycardic to 115 with BP 104/50 using a manual cuff .
Urine output during the prior two hours had been 50cc and 24cc .
A STAT HCT drawn at this time was 19.5 .
The clinical picture was concerning for a post-operative hematoma .
The ICU was alerted to the patient 's disposition and the operating room was activated for urgent re-exploration .
The patient was taken to the OR on POD#0 for re-exploration with incision at 2243 .
Exploratory laparotomy revealed hemoperitonium and approximately 1 L of blood was evacuated .

For specific dates: Use \\\"ON YYYY-MM-DD\\\" (e.g., \\\"ON 2023-05-15\\\")\\n\\n    - For approximate dates: Use \\\"IN YYYY\\\" for years or \\\"IN YYYY-MM\\\" for months (e.g., \\\"IN 1991\\\", \\\"IN 2023-05\\\")\\n\\n    - For relative timings: Use \\\"BEFORE YYYY-MM-DD\\\" or \\\"AFTER YYYY-MM-DD\\\"\\n\\n    - For ranges: Use \\\"YYYY-MM-DD TO YYYY-MM-DD\\\"\\n\\n    - If there is no temporal information: Use \\\"None\\\"\\n\\n    - Always select the most precise format possible, but do not guess or over-specify if the text does not support it.\\n\\nKEY PRINCIPLES: \\n- For relative references (such as \\\"yesterday\\\", \\\"last week\\\", \\\"last winter\\\"), interpret them using a reference date.\\n- For approximate dates (such as \\\"around May\\\"), use the most specific form you can justify.\\n- If several dates are possible, choose the one most relevant to the clinical context.\\n\\nTIMESTAMP TAGS: Look for <T0>, <T1>, etc. as temporal references (e.g., <T0>September 15, 2023</T0>).\\nReturn your answer in JSON format, like this:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"datetime\\\": \\\"[formatted date/time]\\\",\\n  \\\"clues\\\": \\\"[specific text evidence supporting your decision]\\\"\\n}\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n    {\\\"datetime\\\": \\\"ON 2023-05-15\\\", \\\"clues\\\": \\\"procedure performed on May 15, 2023\\\"}\\n\\n    {\\\"datetime\\\": \\\"IN 2022\\\", \\\"clues\\\": \\\"The patient was admitted in 2024, with a diabetes diagnosis two years ago\\\"}\\n\\n    {\\\"datetime\\\": \\\"IN 1992-10\\\", \\\"clues\\\": \\\"CT scan performed in October 1992\\\"}\\n\\n    {\\\"datetime\\\": \\\"BEFORE 2023-05-15\\\", \\\"clues\\\": \\\"symptoms started prior to May 15, 2023\\\"}\\n\\n    {\\\"datetime\\\": \\\"2023-05-15 TO 2023-05-20\\\", \\\"clues\\\": \\\"treatment from May 15 through May 20, 2023\\\"}\\n\\n    {\\\"datetime\\\": \\\"None\\\", \\\"clues\\\": \\\"no temporal information found\\\"}\\n    \\n\\n\\nCLINICAL TEXT: Admission Date :\\n09/29/1993\\nDischarge Date :\\n10/04/1993\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 28-year-old woman who is <E2>HIV positive</E2> for two years .\\nShe presented with <E4>left upper quadrant pain</E4> as well as <E5>nausea</E5> and <E6>vomiting</E6> which is <E7>a long-standing complaint</E7> .\\nShe was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child .\\nShe claims she does not know why she is <E10>HIV positive</E10> .\\nShe is from Maryland , apparently had no <E11>blood transfusions</E11> before the birth of her children so it is presumed <E13>heterosexual transmission</E13> .\\nAt that time , she also had <E14>cat scratch fever</E14> and she had <E15>resection</E15> of <E16>an abscess in the left lower extremity</E16> .\\nShe has not used <E17>any anti retroviral therapy</E17> since then , because of <E18>pancytopenia</E18> and <E19>vomiting</E19> on <E20>DDI</E20> .\\nShe has complaints of <E21>nausea</E21> and <E22>vomiting</E22> as well as <E23>left upper quadrant pain</E23> on and off getting progressively worse over the past month .\\nShe has had <E25>similar pain</E25> intermittently for last year .\\nShe described <E26>the pain</E26> as <E27>a burning pain</E27> which is positional , worse when she walks or does any type of exercise .\\nShe has no relief from <E32>antacids</E32> or <E33>H2 blockers</E33> .\\nIn 10/92 , she had <E34>a CT scan</E34> which showed <E35>fatty infiltration of her liver diffusely</E35> with <E36>a 1 cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver</E36> .\\nShe had a normal pancreas at that time , however , <E38>hyperdense kidneys</E38> .\\n<E39>Her alkaline phosphatase</E39> was <E40>slightly elevated</E40> but otherwise relatively normal .\\n<E42>Her amylase</E42> was <E43>mildly elevated</E43> but has been down since then .\\nThe patient has had <E45>progressive failure to thrive</E45> and <E46>steady weight loss</E46> .\\nShe was brought in for <E47>an esophagogastroduodenoscopy</E47> on 9/26 but she basically was not sufficiently <E48>sedated</E48> and readmitted at this time for <E50>a GI work-up</E50> as well as <E51>an evaluation</E51> of <E52>new abscess in her left lower calf</E52> and right medial lower extremity quadriceps muscle .\\nShe was also admitted to be connected up with social services for <E55>HIV</E55> patients .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted and <E57>many cultures</E57> were sent which were all negative .\\nShe did not have any of <E59>her pain</E59> in the hospital .\\nOn the third hospital day , she did have <E61>some pain</E61> and was treated with <E62>Percocet</E62> .\\nShe went for <E63>a debridement</E63> of <E64>her left calf lesion</E64> on 10/2/93 and was started empirically on <E65>IV ceftriaxone</E65> which was changed to <E66>po doxycycline</E66> on the day of discharge .\\n<E68>A follow-up CT scan</E68> was done which did not show any <E70>evidence</E70> for <E71>splenomegaly</E71> or <E72>hepatomegaly</E72> .\\n<E73>The 1 cm cyst</E73> which was seen in 10/92 was still present .\\nThere was a question of <E74>a cyst in her kidney</E74> with <E75>a stone</E75> right below <E76>the cyst</E76> , although this did not seem to be clinically significant .\"}],\n",

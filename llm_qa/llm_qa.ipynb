Examples:\\n   * APPROXIMATELY IN 2001  \\n   * APPROXIMATELY 1999-01-01 TO 2000-01-01\\n\\n2. **Negative Events**  \\n   For events described as *not* occurring, estimate when the absence began — not when it was recorded. Use contextual clues.  \\n   For example, if a note says, “the patient has been coughing for two years but never had a fever,” the negative event “fever” should be dated to when the cough began — two years ago.\\n\\n3. **Planned or Future Events**  \\n   For events scheduled but not yet occurred (e.g., planned procedures), estimate the intended start time. This is typically based on the discharge date or any future timeframe explicitly stated in the document.\\n\\nTIMESTAMP TAGS: Look for <T0>, <T1>, etc. as temporal references (e.g., <T0>September 15, 2023</T0>).SECTION CONTEXT:\\nIf the text lacks clear temporal markers, use the surrounding section context to help determine the timing of events:\\n- Events in \\'History of Present Illness\\' or similar sections: use admission dates as reference points.\\n- Events in \\'Hospital Course\\' or discharge sections: use discharge dates as reference points.\\nReturn your answer in JSON format, like this:\\n\\n[\\n  {\\n    \"event_id\": \"[the ID of the event (e.g., \"E3\", \"E5\")]\",\\n    \"datetime\": \"[formatted date/time]\",\\n    \"clues\": \"[specific text evidence supporting your decision]\"\\n  }\\n]\\n'}"
